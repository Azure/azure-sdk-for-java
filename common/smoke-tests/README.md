# Azure Smoke Test for Java
This sample code is a smoke test to ensure that Azure Preview for Java work while loaded into the same process by performing 2 or more actions with them.

Libraries tested:
* keyvault-secrets
* identity
* storage-blob
* event-hubs
* cosmos

## Getting started
### Setup Azure resources
For this sample, it is necessary to create/have the following resources in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/):
* **App registration**: Register a new app or use an existing one.
  * Under _Certificates & secrets_ create a new **client secret** and store the value in a safe place.
* **Key Vaults**: Create a new Key Vault resource or use an existing one.
  * Under _Access policies_, add the app registrated in the previous step.
* **Storage acounts**: Create a container in a new or existing storage account. The container in this sample is named "mycontainer", if you want to use other name you can change the value in `BlobStorage.ts` file:
`const containerName = "mycontainer";`
* **Event Hubs**: Create an event hub inside a new or existing Event Hubs Namespace. The container in this sample is named "myeventhub", if you want to use other name you can change the value in `EventHubsTest.ts` file: `let eventHubName = "myeventhub";`
* **Azure Cosmos DB**: Create a new account or use an existing one.

### Azure credentials
The following environment variables are needed:
* From **App Registration**, in the _Overview_ section:
    * AZURE_TENANT_ID: The directory tentant ID.
    * AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The application ID.
    * AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret stored previusly when creating the _client secret_.

* From **Key Vault**, in the _Overview_ section:
  * AZURE_PROJECT_URL: The DNS Name

* From **Event Hubs**, in _Shared access policies_ section:
  * AZURE_EVENT_HUBS_CONNECTION_STRING: Connection string from a policy

* From **Storage Account**, in the _Access Keys_ section:
  * AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING : A connection strings.

* From **Azure Cosmos DB**, in the _Keys_ section, select the _Read-Write Keys_ tab:
  * AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT: URI.
  * AZURE_COSMOS_KEY: Primary or secondary key.

```bash
# Bash code to create the environment variables
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=""
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=""
export AZURE_EVENT_HUBS_CONNECTION_STRING=""
export AZURE_AZURE_PROJECT_URL=""
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=""
export AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT=""
export AZURE_COSMOS_KEY=""
```
### Client Logger
The Azure clients use a ClientLogger. Create an environment variable `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` and set it to the desire level:
* Verbose = 1
* Informational = 2
* Warnings = 3
* Errors = 4
* Disabled = 5

### Running the console app
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) version 11.0.4 was used to run this sample.

Install Maven dependencies:

Run `App.main()`:


## Key concepts

## Examples
All the classes in this sample not depend on each other. 

It is possible to run them individually:
```java
package com.azure.smoketest;
import java.io.IOException;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IllegalArgumentException, IOException {
        StorageBlob.main(null);
    }
}
```

The classes can be used as base code and be changed to satisfied specific needs. For example, the method `EventHubs().sendAndReceiveEvents()` can be change to only send events from an array given from a parameter:
```java
private void sendEvents(String partitionId, Flux<EventData> events) {
        EventHubProducer producer = client.createProducer(new EventHubProducerOptions().partitionId(partitionId));

        producer.send(events).subscribe(
            (ignored) -> logger.info("sent"),
            error -> logger.error("Error received:" + error),
            () -> {
                //Closing the producer once is done with sending the events
                try {
                    producer.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        );
    }
```

**Note:** The methods in the classes are not necessary independent on each other, and the order matters. For example, in order to run `StorageBlob.deleteBlob();`, the method `StorageBlob.uploadBLob();` must be run before, since in the other way it will fail because there is not going to be a blob to delete.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication
Be sure to set the environment variables and credentials required before running the sample.

### SLF4J Logger
Be sure to include the SLF4J dependency in the `pom.xml` file.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.28</version>
    </dependency>
```
