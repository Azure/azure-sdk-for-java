/**
 * Client to an append blob. It may only be instantiated through a {@link AppendBlobClientBuilder}, via
 * the method {@link BlobAsyncClient#asAppendBlobAsyncClient()}, or via the method
 * {@link ContainerAsyncClient#getAppendBlobAsyncClient(String)}. This class does not hold
 * any state about a particular blob, but is instead a convenient way of sending appropriate
 * requests to the resource on the service.
 *
 * <p>
 * This client contains operations on a blob. Operations on a container are available on {@link ContainerAsyncClient},
 * and operations on the service are available on {@link StorageAsyncClient}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Please refer
 * to the <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs>Azure Docs</a>
 * for more information.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note this client is an async client that returns reactive responses from Spring Reactor Core
 * project (https://projectreactor.io/). Calling the methods in this client will <strong>NOT</strong>
 * start the actual network operation, until {@code .subscribe()} is called on the reactive response.
 * You can simply convert one of these responses to a {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture}
 * object through {@link Mono#toFuture()}.
