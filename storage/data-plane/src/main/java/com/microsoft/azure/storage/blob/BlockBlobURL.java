     *         {@code Context} offers a means of passing arbitrary data (key/value pairs) to an
     *         {@link com.microsoft.rest.v2.http.HttpPipeline}'s policy objects. Most applications do not need to pass
     *         arbitrary data to the pipeline and can pass {@code Context.NONE} or {@code null}. Each context object is
     *         immutable. The {@code withContext} with data method creates a new {@code Context} object that refers to
     *         its parent, forming a linked list.
