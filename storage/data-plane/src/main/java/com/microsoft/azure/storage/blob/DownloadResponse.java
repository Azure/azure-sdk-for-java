/**
 * {@code DownloadResponse} wraps the protocol-layer response from {@link BlobURL#download(BlobRange,
 * BlobAccessConditions, boolean, com.microsoft.rest.v2.Context)} to automatically retry failed reads from the body as
 * appropriate. If the download is interrupted, the {@code DownloadResponse} will make a request to resume the download
 * from where it left off, allowing the user to consume the data as one continuous stream, for any interruptions are
 * hidden. The retry behavior is defined by the options passed to the {@link #body(ReliableDownloadOptions)}. The
 * download will also lock on the blob's etag to ensure consistency.
 * <p>
 * Note that the retries performed as a part of this reader are composed with those of any retries in an {@link
 * HttpPipeline} used in conjunction with this reader. That is, if this object issues a request to resume a download,
 * an underlying pipeline may issue several retries as a part of that request. Furthermore, this reader only retries on
 * network errors; timeouts and unexpected status codes are not retried. Therefore, the behavior of this reader is
 * entirely independent of and in no way coupled to an {@link HttpPipeline}'s retry mechanism.
