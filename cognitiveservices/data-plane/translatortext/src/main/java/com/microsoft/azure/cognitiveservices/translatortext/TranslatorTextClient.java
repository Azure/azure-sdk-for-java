     # Response Body
     A client uses the `scope` query parameter to define which groups of languages it is interested in.
     * `scope=translation` provides languages supported to translate text from one language to another language.
     * `scope=transliteration` provides capabilities for converting text in one language from one script to another script.
     * `scope=dictionary` provides language pairs for which `Dictionary` operations return data.
     A client may retrieve several groups simultaneously by specifying a comma-separated list of names. For example, `scope=translation,transliteration,dictionary` would return supported languages for all groups.
     A successful response is a JSON object with one property for each requested group.
     The value for each property is as follows.
     * `translation` property
       The value of the `translation` property is a dictionary of (key, value) pairs. Each key is a BCP 47 language tag. A key identifies a language for which text can be translated to or translated from. The value associated with the key is a JSON object with properties that describe the language

     The structure of the response object will not change without a change in the version of the API. For the same version of the API, the list of available languages may change over time because Microsoft Translator continually extends the list of languages supported by its services.
     The list of supported languages will not change frequently. To save network bandwidth and improve responsiveness, a client application should consider caching language resources and the corresponding entity tag (`ETag`). Then, the client application can periodically (for example, once every 24 hours) query the service to fetch the latest set of supported languages. Passing the current `ETag` value in an `If-None-Match` header field will allow the service to optimize the response. If the resource has not been modified, the service will return status code 304 and an empty response body.
     # Response Header
     ETag - Current value of the entity tag for the requested groups of supported languages. To make subsequent requests more efficient, the client may send the `ETag` value in an `If-None-Match` header field.

     The list of supported languages will not change frequently. To save network bandwidth and improve responsiveness, a client application should consider caching language resources and the corresponding entity tag (`ETag`). Then, the client application can periodically (for example, once every 24 hours) query the service to fetch the latest set of supported languages. Passing the current `ETag` value in an `If-None-Match` header field will allow the service to optimize the response. If the resource has not been modified, the service will return status code 304 and an empty response body.

     The structure of the response object will not change without a change in the version of the API. For the same version of the API, the list of available languages may change over time because Microsoft Translator continually extends the list of languages supported by its services.
     The list of supported languages will not change frequently. To save network bandwidth and improve responsiveness, a client application should consider caching language resources and the corresponding entity tag (`ETag`). Then, the client application can periodically (for example, once every 24 hours) query the service to fetch the latest set of supported languages. Passing the current `ETag` value in an `If-None-Match` header field will allow the service to optimize the response. If the resource has not been modified, the service will return status code 304 and an empty response body.
     # Response Header
     ETag - Current value of the entity tag for the requested groups of supported languages. To make subsequent requests more efficient, the client may send the `ETag` value in an `If-None-Match` header field.
     X-RequestId - Value generated by the service to identify the request. It is used for troubleshooting purposes.

     * @param scope A comma-separated list of names defining the group of languages to return. Allowed group names are- `translation`, `transliteration` and `dictionary`. If no scope is given, then all groups are returned, which is equivalent to passing `scope=translation,transliteration,dictionary`. To decide which set of supported languages is appropriate for your scenario, see the description of the response object.
     * @param acceptLanguage The language to use for user interface strings. Some of the fields in the response are names of languages or names of regions. Use this parameter to define the language in which these names are returned. The language is specified by providing a well-formed BCP 47 language tag. For instance, use the value `fr` to request names in French or use the value `zh-Hant` to request names in Chinese Traditional. Names are provided in the English language when a target language is not specified or when localization is not available.
     * @param xClientTraceId A client-generated GUID to uniquely identify the request. Note that you can omit this header if you include the trace ID in the query string using a query parameter named ClientTraceId.

    /**
     * Gets the set of languages currently supported by other operations of the Translator Text API.
     **Authentication is not required to get language resources.**
     # Response Body
     A client uses the `scope` query parameter to define which groups of languages it is interested in.
     * `scope=translation` provides languages supported to translate text from one language to another language.
     * `scope=transliteration` provides capabilities for converting text in one language from one script to another script.
     * `scope=dictionary` provides language pairs for which `Dictionary` operations return data.
     A client may retrieve several groups simultaneously by specifying a comma-separated list of names. For example, `scope=translation,transliteration,dictionary` would return supported languages for all groups.
     A successful response is a JSON object with one property for each requested group.
     The value for each property is as follows.
     * `translation` property
       The value of the `translation` property is a dictionary of (key, value) pairs. Each key is a BCP 47 language tag. A key identifies a language for which text can be translated to or translated from. The value associated with the key is a JSON object with properties that describe the language
       * `name-` Display name of the language in the locale requested via `Accept-Language` header.
       * `nativeName-` Display name of the language in the locale native for this language.
       * `dir-` Directionality, which is `rtl` for right-to-left languages or `ltr` for left-to-right languages.

     * `transliteration` property
       The value of the `transliteration` property is a dictionary of (key, value) pairs. Each key is a BCP 47 language tag. A key identifies a language for which text can be converted from one script to another script. The value associated with the key is a JSON object with properties that describe the language and its supported scripts
       * `name-` Display name of the language in the locale requested via `Accept-Language` header.
       * `nativeName-` Display name of the language in the locale native for this language.
