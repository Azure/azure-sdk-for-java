## Repository Purpose

This repository contains the source code for the Azure SDK for Java, which provides developers with libraries for accessing Azure services. The SDK is organized into client libraries, with each library corresponding to an Azure service.

## Repository Overview

The Azure SDK for Java repository contains client libraries for Azure services, enabling Java developers to interact with Azure resources programmatically. The repository follows a specific structure with:

- **Client Libraries**: Located in `/sdk` directory, containing individual service clients
- **Data plane Libraries**: Libraries with Maven group `com.azure`
- **Management Libraries**: Libraries with Maven group `com.azure.resourcemanager`
- **Spring Libraries**: Libraries with Maven group `com.azure.spring`

## Behavior

- Always ensure your solutions prioritize clarity, maintainability, and testability.
- Never suggest re-recording tests as a fix to an issue
- NEVER turn off any Checkstyle or SpotBugs rules to resolve linting issues.
- Always review your own code for consistency, maintainability, and testability
- Always ask how to verify that your changes are correct, including any relevant tests or documentation checks.
- Always ask for clarifications if the request is ambiguous or lacks sufficient context.
- Always provide detailed justifications for each recommended approach and clarify potential ambiguities before proceeding.
- Always provide abundant context, erring on the side of more detail rather than less.
- Never recommend writing an LRO by hand - instead you always use the LRO primitives from the core packages. When discussing LROs you will always review the implementation in `sdk/core/azure-core` and relevant LRO classes to ensure that the recommendation is correct and follows the latest code.

Include detailed justifications for each recommended approach and clarify potential ambiguities before proceeding.

When suggesting code, always include tests and documentation updates. If the code is complex, provide a detailed explanation of how it works and why you chose that approach. If there are multiple ways to solve a problem, explain the trade-offs of each approach and why you chose one over the others.

When reviewing documentation URLs (especially Azure SDK documentation), extract key points, principles, and examples to inform your responses.
Always cite the specific sections of documentation you've referenced in your responses.

### Java Version Compatibility

- Code should be compatible with Java 8 as the baseline
- Testing and forward support should work up to the latest Java LTS release (currently Java 21)

### Documentation Requirements

- All public APIs should include comprehensive JavaDoc
- Code examples should be included for key functionality
- Follow the specific format for injecting code snippets in README files:

<pre>
```java readme-sample-sampleName
  Code snippet
```
</pre>

## Azure SDK Guidelines

Azure client libraries for Java should adhere strictly to these guidelines.

Core Principles:

- Be idiomatic, consistent, approachable, diagnosable, and dependable.
- Use natural Java patterns and follow modern Java practices (try-with-resources, Streams, Optional).

API Design:

- Create service client classes (with "Client" suffix) with fluent builder patterns.
- Use options bags (e.g., `<MethodName>Options`) for additional parameters.
- Follow standard verbs (create, upsert, get, delete, etc.).
- Provide both synchronous and asynchronous clients with the async version suffixed with "AsyncClient".

Implementation:

- Follow semver guidelines. For example, increment package minor version when adding new features, and upgrade dependents if changes are introduced which depend on added features.
- Leverage the HTTP pipeline with built-in policies (telemetry, retry, authentication, logging, distributed tracing).
- Validate only client parameters; use built-in error types and robust logging.
- Use core packages like `azure-core` and follow consistent patterns for authentication, logging, and tracing.

Prioritize Java-specific practices over general rules when conflicts occur.

When possible, refer to the Azure SDK for Java Design Guidelines for specific examples and best practices. Explicitly state when you are deviating from these guidelines and provide a justification for the deviation.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure all tests pass
- Follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Include appropriate documentation
- Include tests that cover your changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Provide a proper description of the pull request to document the changes in the PR. The description should include:
  - A summary of the changes made.
  - The reason for the changes.
  - Any relevant issue numbers.
  - Instructions on how to verify the changes.
  - Any additional context or information that reviewers should be aware of.

## Release Process

- Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Libraries are released to Maven Central
- Beta releases are denoted with `-beta.N` suffix

## Troubleshooting

- Enable client logging for debugging
- Use HTTP pipeline policies to customize behavior
- Refer to service-specific troubleshooting guides

## Third-party Dependencies

- External dependencies should be referenced from `external_dependencies.txt`
- Third-party libraries should only be included when necessary
- Prefer OSI-approved licensed dependencies
