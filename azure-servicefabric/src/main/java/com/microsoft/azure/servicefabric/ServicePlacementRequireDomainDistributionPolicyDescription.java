/**
 * Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
 * where two replicas from the same partition should never be placed in the
 * same fault or upgrade domain.
 *
 * While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of
 * concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of
 * subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where
 * replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per
 * location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally
 * the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of
 * the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy should
 * be set.
