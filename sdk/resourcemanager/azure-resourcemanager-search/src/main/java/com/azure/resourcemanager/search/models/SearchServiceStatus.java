 * The status of the search service. Possible values include: 'running': The search service is running and no
 * provisioning operations are underway. 'provisioning': The search service is being provisioned or scaled up or down.
 * 'deleting': The search service is being deleted. 'degraded': The search service is degraded. This can occur when the
 * underlying search units are not healthy. The search service is most likely operational, but performance might be slow
 * and some requests might be dropped. 'disabled': The search service is disabled. In this state, the service will
 * reject all API requests. 'error': The search service is in an error state. If your service is in the degraded,
 * disabled, or error states, Microsoft is actively investigating the underlying issue. Dedicated services in these
 * states are still chargeable based on the number of search units provisioned.
