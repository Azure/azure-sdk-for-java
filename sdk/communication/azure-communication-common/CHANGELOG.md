## 1.1.0 (2022-02-23)

### Features Added

- Added new constructor with required param `tokenRefresher` for `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions`
- Deprecated old constructor overloads in `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions` and replaced by fluent setters
- Added fluent setters for optional properties:
    - Added `setRefreshProactively(boolean refreshProactively)` setter that allows setting whether the token should be proactively renewed prior to its expiry or on demand.
    - Added `setInitialToken(String initialToken)` setter that allows setting the optional serialized JWT token
- Added a synchronous token refresher getter `getTokenRefresherSync` for `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions`
- Optimization added: When the proactive refreshing is enabled and the token refresher fails to provide a token that's not about to expire soon, the subsequent refresh attempts will be scheduled for when the token reaches half of its remaining lifetime until a token with long enough validity (>10 minutes) is obtained.
