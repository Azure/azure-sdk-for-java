# Azure Communication Service Common client library for Java

Azure Communication Common contains data structures commonly used for communicating with Azure Communication Services. 
It is intended to provide cross-cutting concerns, e.g. authentication. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource.

#### Include the BOM file

Please include the azure-sdk-bom to your project to take dependency on GA version of the library. In the following snippet, replace the {bom_version_to_target} placeholder with the version number.
To learn more about the BOM, see the [AZURE SDK BOM README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/main/sdk/boms/azure-sdk-bom/README.md).

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```
and then include the direct dependency in the dependencies section without the version tag.

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-common</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Include direct dependency
If you want to take dependency on a particular version of the library that is not present in the BOM,
add the direct dependency to your project as follows.

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-communication-common;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-common</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## Key concepts

To work with Azure Communication Services, a resource access key is used for authentication. 

Azure Communication Service supports HMAC authentication with resource access key. To
apply HMAC authentication, construct CommunicationClientCredential with the access key and instantiate
a CommunicationIdentityClient to manage users and tokens.

### CommunicationTokenCredential

It is up to you the developer to first create valid user tokens with the Communication Identity SDK. Then you use these tokens with the `CommunicationTokenCredential`.

`CommunicationTokenCredential` authenticates a user with Communication Services, such as Chat or Calling. It optionally provides an auto-refresh mechanism to ensure a continuously stable authentication state during communications.
