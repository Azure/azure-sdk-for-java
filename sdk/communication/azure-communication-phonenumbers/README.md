## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.

### Include the package
#### Include the BOM file

Please include the azure-sdk-bom to your project to take dependency on the General Availability (GA) version of the library. In the following snippet, replace the {bom_version_to_target} placeholder with the version number.
To learn more about the BOM, see the [AZURE SDK BOM README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/boms/azure-sdk-bom/README.md).

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```
and then include the direct dependency in the dependencies section without the version tag.

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-phonenumbers</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Include direct dependency
If you want to take dependency on a particular version of the library that is not present in the BOM,
add the direct dependency to your project as follows.


[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-communication-phonenumbers;current})
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-communication-phonenumbers</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts

This SDK provides functionality to easily manage `direct offer` and `direct routing` numbers.

The `direct offer` numbers come in two types: Geographic and Toll-Free. Geographic phone plans are phone plans associated with a location, whose phone numbers' area codes are associated with the area code of a geographic location. Toll-Free phone plans are phone plans not associated location. For example, in the US, toll-free numbers can come with area codes such as 800 or 888.
They are managed using the `PhoneNumbersClient`

The `direct routing` feature enables connecting your existing telephony infrastructure to ACS.
The configuration is managed using the `SipRoutingClient`, which provides methods for setting up SIP trunks and voice routing rules, in order to properly handle calls for your telephony subnet.

### Initializing Client
Clients can be initialized using the Azure Active Directory Authentication.

```java readme-sample-createPhoneNumberClientWithAAD
// You can find your endpoint and access key from your resource in the Azure Portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";

// Create an HttpClient builder of your choice and customize it
HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

PhoneNumbersClient phoneNumberClient = new PhoneNumbersClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .httpClient(httpClient)
    .buildClient();
```

```java readme-sample-createSipRoutingClientWithAAD
// You can find your endpoint and access key from your resource in the Azure Portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";

// Create an HttpClient builder of your choice and customize it
HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

SipRoutingClient sipRoutingClient = new SipRoutingClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .httpClient(httpClient)
    .buildClient();
```

Using the endpoint and access key from the communication resource to authenticate is also possible.

```java readme-sample-createPhoneNumberClient
// You can find your endpoint and access token from your resource in the Azure Portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";
AzureKeyCredential keyCredential = new AzureKeyCredential("SECRET");

// Create an HttpClient builder of your choice and customize it
HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

PhoneNumbersClient phoneNumberClient = new PhoneNumbersClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(keyCredential)
    .httpClient(httpClient)
    .buildClient();
```

```java readme-sample-createSipRoutingClient
// You can find your endpoint and access token from your resource in the Azure Portal
String endpoint = "https://<RESOURCE_NAME>.communication.azure.com";
AzureKeyCredential keyCredential = new AzureKeyCredential("SECRET");

// Create an HttpClient builder of your choice and customize it
HttpClient httpClient = new NettyAsyncHttpClientBuilder().build();

SipRoutingClient sipRoutingClient = new SipRoutingClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(keyCredential)
    .httpClient(httpClient)
    .buildClient();
```
Alternatively, you can provide the entire connection string using the connectionString() function of the client instead of providing the endpoint and access key.

### Phone numbers client

#### Phone Number Types overview

Phone numbers come in two types; Geographic and Toll-Free. Geographic phone plans are phone plans associated with a location, whose phone numbers' area codes are associated with the area code of a geographic location. Toll-Free phone plans are phone plans not associated location. For example, in the US, toll-free numbers can come with area codes such as 800 or 888.

#### Searching and Purchasing and Releasing numbers

Phone numbers can be searched through the search creation API by providing an area code, quantity of phone numbers, application type, phone number type, and capabilities. The provided quantity of phone numbers will be reserved for ten minutes and can be purchased within this time. If the search is not purchased, the phone numbers will become available to others after ten minutes. If the search is purchased, then the phone numbers are purchased for the Azure resources.

Phone numbers can also be released using the release API.

### SIP routing client

Direct routing feature allows connecting customer-provided telephony infrastructure to Azure Communication Resources. In order to setup routing configuration properly, customer needs to supply the SIP trunk configuration and SIP routing rules for calls. SIP routing client provides the necessary interface for setting this configuration.

When the call arrives, system tries to match the destination number with regex number patterns of defined routes. The first route to match the number will be selected. The order of regex matching is the same as the order of routes in configuration, therefore the order of routes matters.
Once a route is matched, the call is routed to the first trunk in the route's trunks list. If the trunk is not available, next trunk in the list is selected.

## Examples

### PhoneNumbersClient

#### Get Purchased Phone Number
Gets the specified purchased phone number.

```java readme-sample-getPurchasedPhoneNumber
PurchasedPhoneNumber phoneNumber = phoneNumberClient.getPurchasedPhoneNumber("+18001234567");
System.out.println("Phone Number Value: " + phoneNumber.getPhoneNumber());
System.out.println("Phone Number Country Code: " + phoneNumber.getCountryCode());
```

#### Get All Purchased Phone Numbers
Lists all the purchased phone numbers.

```java readme-sample-listPhoneNumbers
PagedIterable<PurchasedPhoneNumber> phoneNumbers = createPhoneNumberClient().listPurchasedPhoneNumbers(Context.NONE);
PurchasedPhoneNumber phoneNumber = phoneNumbers.iterator().next();
System.out.println("Phone Number Value: " + phoneNumber.getPhoneNumber());
System.out.println("Phone Number Country Code: " + phoneNumber.getCountryCode());
```

### Long Running Operations

The Phone Number Client supports a variety of long-running operations that allow indefinite polling time to the functions listed down below.

#### Search for Available Phone Numbers
Search for available phone numbers by providing the area code, assignment type, phone number capabilities, phone number type, and quantity. The result of the search can then be used to purchase the numbers. Note that for the toll-free phone number type, providing the area code is optional.

```java readme-sample-searchAvailablePhoneNumbers
PhoneNumbersClient phoneNumberClient = createPhoneNumberClient();
PhoneNumberCapabilities capabilities = new PhoneNumberCapabilities()
    .setCalling(PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND)
    .setSms(PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND);
PhoneNumberSearchOptions searchOptions = new PhoneNumberSearchOptions().setAreaCode("800").setQuantity(1);

SyncPoller<PhoneNumberOperation, PhoneNumberSearchResult> poller = phoneNumberClient
    .beginSearchAvailablePhoneNumbers("US", PhoneNumberType.TOLL_FREE, PhoneNumberAssignmentType.APPLICATION, capabilities, searchOptions, Context.NONE);
PollResponse<PhoneNumberOperation> response = poller.waitForCompletion();
String searchId = "";

if (LongRunningOperationStatus.SUCCESSFULLY_COMPLETED == response.getStatus()) {
    PhoneNumberSearchResult searchResult = poller.getFinalResult();
    searchId = searchResult.getSearchId();
    System.out.println("Searched phone numbers: " + searchResult.getPhoneNumbers());
    System.out.println("Search expires by: " + searchResult.getSearchExpiresBy());
    System.out.println("Phone number costs:" + searchResult.getCost().getAmount());
}
```

#### Purchase Phone Numbers
The result of searching for phone numbers is a `PhoneNumberSearchResult`. This can be used to get the numbers' details and purchase numbers by passing in the `searchId` to the purchase number API.

```java readme-sample-purchasePhoneNumbers
PollResponse<PhoneNumberOperation> purchaseResponse =
    phoneNumberClient.beginPurchasePhoneNumbers(searchId, Context.NONE).waitForCompletion();
System.out.println("Purchase phone numbers is complete: " + purchaseResponse.getStatus());
```

#### Release Phone Number
Releases a purchased phone number.

```java readme-sample-releasePhoneNumber
PollResponse<PhoneNumberOperation> releaseResponse =
    phoneNumberClient.beginReleasePhoneNumber("+18001234567", Context.NONE).waitForCompletion();
System.out.println("Release phone number is complete: " + releaseResponse.getStatus());
```

#### Updating Phone Number Capabilities
Updates Phone Number Capabilities for Calling and SMS to one of:
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityValue.NONE`
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityValue.INBOUND`
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityValue.OUTBOUND`
- `PhoneNumberCapabilityValue.INBOUND_OUTBOUND`

```java readme-sample-updatePhoneNumberCapabilities
PhoneNumberCapabilities capabilities = new PhoneNumberCapabilities();
capabilities
    .setCalling(PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND)
    .setSms(PhoneNumberCapabilityType.INBOUND_OUTBOUND);

SyncPoller<PhoneNumberOperation, PurchasedPhoneNumber> poller = phoneNumberClient.beginUpdatePhoneNumberCapabilities("+18001234567", capabilities, Context.NONE);
PollResponse<PhoneNumberOperation> response = poller.waitForCompletion();

if (LongRunningOperationStatus.SUCCESSFULLY_COMPLETED == response.getStatus()) {
    PurchasedPhoneNumber phoneNumber = poller.getFinalResult();
    System.out.println("Phone Number Calling capabilities: " + phoneNumber.getCapabilities().getCalling()); //Phone Number Calling capabilities: inbound
    System.out.println("Phone Number SMS capabilities: " + phoneNumber.getCapabilities().getSms()); //Phone Number SMS capabilities: inbound+outbound
}
```

### SipRoutingClient

#### Retrieve SIP trunks and routes

Get the list of currently configured trunks or routes.

```java readme-sample-listTrunksAndRoutes
PagedIterable<SipTrunk> trunks = sipRoutingClient.listTrunks();
PagedIterable<SipTrunkRoute> routes = sipRoutingClient.listRoutes();
for (SipTrunk trunk : trunks) {
    System.out.println("Trunk " + trunk.getFqdn() + ":" + trunk.getSipSignalingPort());
}
for (SipTrunkRoute route : routes) {
    System.out.println("Route name: " + route.getName());
    System.out.println("Route description: " + route.getDescription());
    System.out.println("Route number pattern: " + route.getNumberPattern());
    System.out.println("Route trunks: " + String.join(",", route.getTrunks()));
}
```

#### Replace SIP trunks and routes

Replace the list of currently configured trunks or routes with new values.

```java readme-sample-setTrunksAndRoutes
sipRoutingClient.setTrunks(asList(
    new SipTrunk("<first trunk fqdn>", 12345),
    new SipTrunk("<second trunk fqdn>", 23456)
));
sipRoutingClient.setRoutes(asList(
    new SipTrunkRoute("route name1", ".*9").setTrunks(asList("<first trunk fqdn>", "<second trunk fqdn>")),
    new SipTrunkRoute("route name2", ".*").setTrunks(asList("<second trunk fqdn>"))
));
```

#### Retrieve single trunk

```java readme-sample-getTrunk
String fqdn = "<trunk fqdn>";
SipTrunk trunk = sipRoutingClient.getTrunk(fqdn);
if (trunk != null) {
    System.out.println("Trunk " + trunk.getFqdn() + ":" + trunk.getSipSignalingPort());
} else {
    System.out.println("Trunk not found. " + fqdn);
}
```

#### Set single trunk

```java readme-sample-setTrunk
sipRoutingClient.setTrunk(new SipTrunk("<trunk fqdn>", 12345));
```

#### Delete single trunk

```java readme-sample-deleteTrunk
sipRoutingClient.deleteTrunk("<trunk fqdn>");
```
