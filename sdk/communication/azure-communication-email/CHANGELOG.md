- The `EmailMessage` model has been reworked. It now accepts properties through setters. The EmailRecipients and EmailContent objects have been removed.
- The `getSendStatus` method has been removed.
- The `EmailAttachment` constructor now accepts BinaryData instead of a string
- The `contentBytesBase64` property under `attachments` has been changed to `contentInBase64`
- The `attachmentType` property under `attachments` has been changed to 'contentType'. This now accepts the attachment mime type.
- The `sender` property has been changed to `senderAddress`.
- The `email` property under the recipient object has been changed to `address`.
- Custom headers in the email message are now key/value pairs.
- The importance property was removed. Email importance can now be specified through either the `x-priority` or `x-msmail-priority` custom headers.

## 1.0.0-beta.1 (2022-08-09)
