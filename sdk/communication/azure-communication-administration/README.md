# Azure Communication Administration client library for Java

The administration package previously provided capabilities for User and Token Management and for Phone Number Administration.

Now, User and Token Management capabilities have been moved to `azure.communication.identity`.
Phone Number Administration has been moved to `azure.communication.phonenumbers`.
