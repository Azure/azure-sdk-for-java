## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.

## Key concepts
This is the restart of CallingServer Service. It is renamed to Call Automation service and being more intuitive to use.

`CallAutomationClient` provides the functionality to make call, answer/reject incoming call and redirect a call.

`CallConnection` provides the functionality to perform actions in an established call connection such as adding participants and terminate the call.

`CallMedia` introduces media related functionalities into the call.

`CallRecording` provides the functionality of recording the call.

`EventHandler` provides the functionality to handle events from the ACS resource.

## Examples

To be determined.

## Troubleshooting

If you recieve a CommunicationErrorException with the messagae: "Action is invalid when call is not in Established state." This usually means the call has ended. This can occur if the participants all leave
the call, or participants did not accept the call before the call timed out. 

If you fail to start a call because of an HMAC validation error, be sure your access key is correct, and
that you are passing in a valid conversation id.
