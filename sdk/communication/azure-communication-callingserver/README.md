## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.

## Key concepts

`CallAutomationClient` provides the functionality to make call connection, join call connection, answer incoming call or initialize a server call.

`EventHandler` provides the functionality to handle event grid events as well as callback events from the ACS resource.

## Examples

To be Determined

## Troubleshooting

If you recieve a CommunicationErrorException with the messagae: "Action is invalid when call is not in Established state." This usually means the call has ended. This can occur if the participants all leave
the call, or participants did not accept the call before the call timed out. 

If you fail to start a call because of an HMAC validation error, be sure your access key is correct, and
that you are passing in a valid conversation id.
