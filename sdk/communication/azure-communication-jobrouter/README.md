[Source code][source] | [Package (Maven)][package] | [API reference documentation][api_documentation]
| [Product documentation][product_docs]

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/jdk/?view=azure-java-stable) version 8 or above.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
### Include the package
#### Include the BOM file

Please include the azure-sdk-bom to your project to take dependency on the General Availability (GA) version of the library. In the following snippet, replace the {bom_version_to_target} placeholder with the version number.
To learn more about the BOM, see the [AZURE SDK BOM README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/boms/azure-sdk-bom/README.md).

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```
and then include the direct dependency in the dependencies section without the version tag.

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-jobrouter</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Include direct dependency
If you want to take dependency on a particular version of the library that is not present in the BOM,
add the direct dependency to your project as follows.

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-communication-jobrouter;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-communication-jobrouter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts

### Job

A Job is a unit of work (demand), which must be routed to an available Worker (supply). A real-world example is an incoming call or chat in the context of a call center.

### Worker

A Worker is the supply available to handle a Job. When you use the SDK to register a Worker to receive jobs, you can specify:

- One or more queues to listen on.
- The number of concurrent jobs per Channel that the Worker can handle.
- A set of Labels that can be used to group and select workers.

A real-world example is an agent in a call center.

### Queue

A Queue is an ordered list of jobs, that are waiting to be served to a worker. Workers register with a queue to receive work from it.

A real-world example is a call queue in a call center.

### Channel

A Channel is a grouping of jobs by some type. When a worker registers to receive work, they must also specify for which channels they can handle work, and how much of each can they handle concurrently. Channels are just a string discriminator and aren't explicitly created.

Real-world examples are `voice calls` or `chats` in a call center.

### Offer

An Offer is extended by Job Router to a worker to handle a particular job when it determines a match. You can either accept or decline the offer with the JobRouter SDK. If you ignore the offer, it expires according to the time to live configured on the Distribution Policy.

A real-world example is the ringing of an agent in a call center.


### Distribution Policy

A Distribution Policy is a configuration set that controls how jobs in a queue are distributed to workers registered with that queue. This configuration includes:

- How long an Offer is valid before it expires.
- The distribution mode, which define the order in which workers are picked when there are multiple available.
- How many concurrent offers can there be for a given job.

### Labels

You can attach labels to workers, jobs, and queues. Labels are key value pairs that can be of `string`, `number`, or `boolean` data types.

A real-world example is the skill level of a particular worker or the team or geographic location.

### Worker selectors

Worker selectors can be attached to a job in order to target a subset of workers on the queue.

A real-world example is a condition on an incoming call that the agent must have a minimum level of knowledge of a particular product.

### Classification policy

A classification policy can be used to programmatically select a queue, determine job priority, or attach worker label selectors to a job.

### Queue selectors

Queue selectors can be attached to a classification policy in order to target a queue which fulfills certain conditions.
This queue is used enqueueing an incoming job.

A real-world example is a condition on an incoming call that the call has to get queued to a queue which supports `chat`.


### Exception policy

An exception policy controls the behavior of a Job based on a trigger and executes a desired action. The exception policy is attached to a Queue so it can control the behavior of Jobs in the Queue.


## Examples

### Client Initialization
To initialize the JobRouter Client, the connection string can be used to instantiate.
Alternatively, you can also use Active Directory authentication using DefaultAzureCredential.

```java 
JobRouterClient jobRouterClient = new JobRouterClientBuilder()
            .connectionString(connectionString)
            .buildClient();
```

Using `JobRouterClient` created from builder, create Job Router entities as described below.

### Create a Distribution Policy

```java 
CreateDistributionPolicyOptions createDistributionPolicyOptions = new CreateDistributionPolicyOptions(
    "distribution-policy-id",
    10.0,
    new LongestIdleMode()
        .setMinConcurrentOffers(1)
        .setMaxConcurrentOffers(10)
);
DistributionPolicy distributionPolicy = jobRouterClient.createDistributionPolicy(createDistributionPolicyOptions);
```

### Create a Queue

```java 
CreateQueueOptions createQueueOptions = new CreateQueueOptions("queue-id", distributionPolicy.getId());
RouterQueue jobQueue = jobRouterClient.createQueue(createQueueOptions);
```

### Create a Job

```java 
CreateJobOptions createJobOptions = new CreateJobOptions("job-id", "chat-channel", queueId)
            .setPriority(1)
            .setChannelReference("12345")
            .setRequestedWorkerSelectors(
                new ArrayList<>() {{
                    new RouterWorkerSelector()
                        .setKey("Some-skill")
                        .setLabelOperator(LabelOperator.GREATER_THAN)
                        .setValue(new LabelValue(10));
                }}
            );
RouterJob routerJob = jobRouterClient.createJob(createJobOptions);
```

### Create a Worker

```java 
Map<String, LabelValue> labels = new HashMap<String, LabelValue>() {
    {
        put("Label", new LabelValue("Value"));
    }
};

Map<String, LabelValue> tags = new HashMap<String, LabelValue>() {
    {
        put("Tag", new LabelValue("Value"));
    }
};

Map<String, ChannelConfiguration> channelConfigurations = new HashMap<String, ChannelConfiguration>() {
    {
        put("channel1", new ChannelConfiguration().setCapacityCostPerJob(1));
    }
};

Map<String, RouterQueueAssignment> queueAssignments = new HashMap<String, RouterQueueAssignment>() {
    {
        put(jobQueue.getId(), new RouterQueueAssignment());
    }
};

CreateWorkerOptions createWorkerOptions = new CreateWorkerOptions(workerId, 10)
    .setLabels(labels)
    .setTags(tags)
    .setAvailableForOffers(true)
    .setChannelConfigurations(channelConfigurations)
    .setQueueAssignments(queueAssignments);

RouterWorker routerWorker = jobRouterClient.createWorker(createWorkerOptions);
```
