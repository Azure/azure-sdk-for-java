     * * No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature(s) will be stored on server. The faceId is an
     * identifier of the face feature and will be used in "Identify", "Verify", and "Find Similar". The stored face
     * features will expire and be deleted at the time specified by faceIdTimeToLive after the original detection call.
     * * Optional parameters include faceId, landmarks, and attributes. Attributes include headPose, glasses, occlusion,
     * accessories, blur, exposure, noise, mask, and qualityForRecognition. Some of the results returned for specific
     * attributes may not be highly accurate.
     * * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.
     * * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with
     * dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.
     * * Up to 100 faces can be returned for an image. Faces are ranked by face rectangle size from large to small.
     * * For optimal results when querying "Identify", "Verify", and "Find Similar" ('returnFaceId' is true), please use
     * faces that are: frontal, clear, and with a minimum size of 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes).
     * * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare different detection models, please refer
     * to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/specify-detection-model
     * * 'detection_02': Face attributes and landmarks are disabled if you choose this detection model.
     * * 'detection_03': Face attributes (mask, blur, and headPose) and landmarks are supported if you choose this
     * detection model.
     * * Different 'recognitionModel' values are provided. If follow-up operations like "Verify", "Identify", "Find
     * Similar" are needed, please specify the recognition model with 'recognitionModel' parameter. The default value
     * for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need
     * in this parameter. Once specified, the detected faceIds will be associated with the specified recognition model.

     * <tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr>
     * <tr><td>detectionModel</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>The 'detectionModel' associated with the detected
     * faceIds. Supported 'detectionModel' values include 'detection_01', 'detection_02' and 'detection_03'. The default
     * value is 'detection_01'. Allowed values: "detection_01", "detection_02", "detection_03".</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>recognitionModel</td><td>String</td><td>No</td><td>The 'recognitionModel' associated with the detected
     * faceIds. Supported 'recognitionModel' values include 'recognition_01', 'recognition_02', 'recognition_03' or
     * 'recognition_04'. The default value is 'recognition_01'. 'recognition_04' is recommended since its accuracy is
     * improved on faces wearing masks compared with 'recognition_03', and its overall accuracy is improved compared
     * with 'recognition_01' and 'recognition_02'. Allowed values: "recognition_01", "recognition_02", "recognition_03",

     * value is true.</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>returnFaceAttributes</td><td>List&lt;String&gt;</td><td>No</td><td>Analyze and return the one or more
     * specified face attributes in the comma-separated string like 'returnFaceAttributes=headPose,glasses'. Face
     * attribute analysis has additional computational and time cost. In the form of "," separated string.</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>returnFaceLandmarks</td><td>Boolean</td><td>No</td><td>Return face landmarks of the detected faces or
     * not. The default value is false.</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>returnRecognitionModel</td><td>Boolean</td><td>No</td><td>Return 'recognitionModel' or not. The default
     * value is false. This is only applicable when returnFaceId = true.</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>faceIdTimeToLive</td><td>Integer</td><td>No</td><td>The number of seconds for the face ID being cached.
