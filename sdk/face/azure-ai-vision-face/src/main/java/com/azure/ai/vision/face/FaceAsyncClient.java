     * value is 'detection_01'. 'detection_03' is recommended since its accuracy is improved on smaller faces (64x64

     * faceIds. Supported 'recognitionModel' values include 'recognition_01', 'recognition_02', 'recognition_03' or
     * 'recognition_04'. The default value is 'recognition_01'. 'recognition_04' is recommended since its accuracy is
     * improved on faces wearing masks compared with 'recognition_03', and its overall accuracy is improved compared

     * <tr><td>returnFaceLandmarks</td><td>Boolean</td><td>No</td><td>Return face landmarks of the detected faces or
     * not. The default value is false.</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>returnRecognitionModel</td><td>Boolean</td><td>No</td><td>Return 'recognitionModel' or not. The default
     * value is false. This is only applicable when returnFaceId = true.</td></tr>
