Version 11.0.0-beta.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic 
to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide 
our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).
