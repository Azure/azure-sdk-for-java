## 11.0.0-beta.1 (2020-03-10)

Version 11.0.0-beta.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic 
to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide 
our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).

- Initial release. Please see the README and wiki for information on the new design.
