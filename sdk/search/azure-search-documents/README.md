# Azure Cognitive Search client library for Java

This is the Java client library for [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/).
Azure Cognitive Search is a fully managed cloud search service that provides a rich search experience to custom applications.
This library provides an easy (native) way for a Java developer to interact with the service to accomplish tasks like: 
create and manage indexes, load data, implement search features, execute queries, and handle results.

## Getting started

### Include the package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-search-documents;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-search-documents</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.3</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above][jdk]
- [Azure subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Azure Cognitive Search service][search]

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Azure Cognitive Search service you'll need to create an instance of the Search Client class. 
To make this possible you will need an [api-key of the Azure Cognitive Search service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys).

The SDK provides two clients.

1. SearchIndexClient for all document operations.
2. SearchServiceClient for all CRUD operations on service resources.

#### Create a SearchServiceClient

Once you have the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service [URL endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal#get-a-key-and-url-endpoint) 
and [admin key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys) you can create the SearchServiceClient:

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L40-L43 -->
```Java
SearchServiceClient searchServiceClient = new SearchServiceClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(adminKey))
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L47-L50 -->
```Java
SearchServiceAsyncClient searchServiceAsyncClient = new SearchServiceClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(adminKey))
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

#### Create a SearchIndexClient

To create a SearchIndexClient, you will need an existing index name as well as the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service 
[URL endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal#get-a-key-and-url-endpoint) and 
[query key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys).
Note that you will need an admin key to index documents (query keys only work for queries).

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L54-L58 -->
```Java
SearchIndexClient searchIndexClient = new SearchIndexClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L62-L66 -->
```Java
SearchIndexAsyncClient searchIndexAsyncClient = new SearchIndexClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

## Key concepts

Azure Cognitive Search service has the concepts of search services and indexes and documents, where a search service contains 
one or more indexes that provides persistent storage of searchable data, and data is loaded in the form of JSON documents. 
Data can be pushed to an index from an external data source, but if you use an indexer, it's possible to crawl a data 
source to extract and load data into an index.

There are several types of operations that can be executed against the service:

-   [Index management operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/index-operations). Create, delete, update, or configure a search index.
-   [Document operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/document-operations). Add, update, or delete documents in the index, query the index, or look up specific documents by ID.
-   [Indexer operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/indexer-operations). Automate aspects of an indexing operation by configuring a data source and an indexer that you can schedule or run on demand. This feature is supported for a limited number of data source types.
-   [Skillset operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/skillset-operations). Part of AI workload, a skillset defines a series of a series of enrichment processing steps. A skillset is consumed by an indexer.
-   [Synonym map operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/synonym-map-operations). A synonym map is a service-level resource that contains user-defined synonyms. This resource is maintained independently from search indexes. Once uploaded, you can point any searchable field to the synonym map (one per field).

## Examples

### Create an index

Create Index using `searchIndexClient` instantiated in [Create a SearchServiceClient](#create-a-searchserviceclient)

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L96-L107 -->
```java
Index newIndex = new Index()
    .setName("index_name")
    .setFields(
        Arrays.asList(new Field()
                .setName("Name")
                .setType(DataType.EDM_STRING)
                .setKey(Boolean.TRUE),
            new Field()
                .setName("Cuisine")
                .setType(DataType.EDM_STRING)));
// Create index.
searchServiceClient.createIndex(newIndex);
```
### Upload a Document

Upload hotel document to Search Index using `searchIndexClient` instantiated [Create a SearchIndexClient](#create-a-searchindexclient)

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L111-L116 -->
```java
List<Hotel> hotels = new ArrayList<>();
hotels.add(new Hotel().setHotelId("100"));
hotels.add(new Hotel().setHotelId("200"));
hotels.add(new Hotel().setHotelId("300"));
// Upload hotel.
searchIndexClient.uploadDocuments(hotels);
```

### Search on hotel name

Search hotel using keyword using `searchIndexClient` instantiated in [Create a SearchIndexClient](#create-a-searchindexclient)

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L120-L130 -->
```java
// Perform a text-based search
for (SearchResult result : searchIndexClient.search("luxury hotel",
    new SearchOptions(), new RequestOptions(), Context.NONE)) {

    // Each result is a dynamic Map
    SearchDocument doc = result.getDocument();
    String hotelName = (String) doc.get("HotelName");
    Double rating = (Double) doc.get("Rating");

    System.out.printf("%s: %s%n", hotelName, rating);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with Azure Cognitive Search using this Java client library, errors returned by the service correspond 
to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][rest_api] requests. For example, if you try to retrieve a document 
that doesn't exist in your index, a `404` error is returned, indicating `Not Found`.

### Enabling Logging

Azure SDKs for Java offer a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite 
their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help 
locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Default HTTP Client

By default a Netty based HTTP client will be used, for more information on configuring or changing the HTTP client is 
detailed in the [HTTP clients wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/HTTP-clients).
