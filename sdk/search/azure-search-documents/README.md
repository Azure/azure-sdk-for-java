# Azure Cognitive Search client library for Java
This is the Java client library for [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/). 
Azure Cognitive Search service is a
search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools
for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content
in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

The Azure Cognitive Search service is well suited for the following
 application scenarios:

* Consolidate varied content types into a single searchable index.
  To populate an index, you can push JSON documents that contain your content,
  or if your data is already in Azure, create an indexer to pull in data
  automatically.
* Attach skillsets to an indexer to create searchable content from images
  and large text documents. A skillset leverages AI from Cognitive Services
  for built-in OCR, entity recognition, key phrase extraction, language
  detection, text translation, and sentiment analysis. You can also add
  custom skills to integrate external processing of your content during
  data ingestion.
* In a search client application, implement query logic and user experiences
  similar to commercial web search engines.

Use the Azure Search client library to:

* Submit queries for simple and advanced query forms that include fuzzy
  search, wildcard search, regular expressions.
* Implement filtered queries for faceted navigation, geospatial search,
  or to narrow results based on filter criteria.
* Create and manage search indexes.
* Upload and update documents in the search index.
* Create and manage indexers that pull data from Azure into an index.
* Create and manage skillsets that add AI enrichment to data ingestion.
* Create and manage analyzers for advanced text analysis or multi-lingual content.
* Optimize results through scoring profiles to factor in business logic or freshness.

## Getting started

### Include the package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-search-documents;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-search-documents</artifactId>
    <version>11.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above][jdk]
- [Azure subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Azure Cognitive Search service][search]
- To create a new search service, you can use the [Azure portal][create_search_service_docs],
[Azure PowerShell][create_search_service_ps], or the [Azure CLI][create_search_service_cli].
Here's an example using the Azure CLI to create a free instance for getting started:

```
az search service create --name <mysearch> --resource-group <mysearch-rg> --sku free --location westus
```

- See [choosing a pricing tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-sku-tier)
 for more information about available options.
 
### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Azure Cognitive Search service you'll need to create an instance of the Search Client class. 
To make this possible you will need, 
1. [URL endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal#get-a-key-and-url-endpoint) and
1. All requests to a search service need an api-key that was generated specifically
for your service. [The api-key is the sole mechanism for authenticating access to
your search service endpoint.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-security-api-keys)
You can obtain your api-key from the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or via the Azure CLI:

```
az search admin-key show --service-name <mysearch> --resource-group <mysearch-rg>
```
**Note:**
1. The example Azure CLI snippet above retrieves an admin key so it's easier
to get started exploring APIs, but it should be managed carefully.
1. There are two types of keys used to access your search service: **admin**
*(read-write)* and **query** *(read-only)* keys.  Restricting access and
operations in client apps is essential to safeguarding the search assets on your
service.  Always use a query key rather than an admin key for any query
originating from a client app.



The SDK provides three clients.

1. SearchIndexClient for all CRUD operations on index and synonym maps.
1. SearchIndexerClient for all CRUD operations on indexer, date source, and skillset.
1. SearchClient for all document operations.

#### Create a SearchIndexClient

To create a `SearchIndexClient/SearchIndexAsyncClient`, you will need the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service 
URL endpoint and admin key.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L69-L72 -->
```Java
SearchIndexClient searchIndexClient = new SearchIndexClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L76-L79 -->
```Java
SearchIndexAsyncClient searchIndexAsyncClient = new SearchIndexClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

#### Create a SearchIndexerClient

To create a `SearchIndexerClient/SearchIndexerAsyncClient`, you will need the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service 
URL endpoint and admin key.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L83-L86 -->
```Java
SearchIndexerClient searchIndexerClient = new SearchIndexerClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L90-L93 -->
```Java
SearchIndexerAsyncClient searchIndexerAsyncClient = new SearchIndexerClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

#### Create a SearchClient

Once you have the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service URL endpoint and 
admin key, you can create the `SearchClient/SearchAsyncClient` with an existing index name:

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L53-L57 -->
```Java
SearchClient searchClient = new SearchClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(adminKey))
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L61-L65 -->
```Java
SearchAsyncClient searchAsyncClient = new SearchClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(adminKey))
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

### Send your first search query

To get running immediately, we're going to connect to a well-known sandbox
Search service provided by Microsoft. This means you do not need an Azure
subscription or Azure Cognitive Search service to try out this query.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L122-L147 -->
```Java
// We'll connect to the Azure Cognitive Search public sandbox and send a
// query to its "nycjobs" index built from a public dataset of available jobs
// in New York.
String serviceName = "azs-playground";
String indexName = "nycjobs";
String apiKey = "252044BE3886FE4A8E3BAA4F595114BB";

// Create a SearchClient to send queries
String serviceEndpoint = String.format("https://%s.search.windows.net/", serviceName);
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey);
SearchClient client = new SearchClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(serviceEndpoint)
    .credential(credential)
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildClient();

// Let's get the top 5 jobs related to Microsoft
SearchPagedIterable searchResultsIterable = client.search("Microsoft", new SearchOptions().setTop(5),
    Context.NONE);
for (SearchResult searchResult: searchResultsIterable) {
    SearchDocument document = searchResult.getDocument(SearchDocument.class);
    String title = (String) document.get("business_title");
    String description = (String) document.get("job_description");
    System.out.printf("The business title is %s, and here is the description: %s.%n",
        title, description);
}
```

## Key concepts

An Azure Cognitive Search service contains one or more indexes that provide
persistent storage of searchable data in the form of JSON documents.  _(If
you're brand new to search, you can make a very rough analogy between
indexes and database tables.)_  The Azure.Search.Documents client library
exposes operations on these resources through two main client types.

* `SearchClient` helps with:
  * [Searching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-lucene-query-architecture)
    your indexed documents using
    [rich queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-query-overview)
    and [powerful data shaping](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-filters)
  * [Autocompleting](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/autocomplete)
    partially typed search terms based on documents in the index
  * [Suggesting](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/suggestions)
    the most likely matching text in documents as a user types
  * [Adding, Updating or Deleting Documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents)
    documents from an index

* `SearchIndexClient` allows you to:
  * [Create, delete, update, or configure a search index](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/index-operations)
  * [Declare custom synonym maps to expand or rewrite queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/synonym-map-operations)
  * Most of the `SearchServiceClient` functionality is not yet available in our current preview

* `SearchIndexerClient` allows you to:
  * [Start indexers to automatically crawl data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/indexer-operations)
  * [Define AI powered Skillsets to transform and enrich your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/skillset-operations)

## Examples

#### Use `SearchDocument` like a dictionary

`SearchDocument` is the default type returned from queries when you don't
provide your own.  Here we perform the search, enumerate over the results, and
extract data using `SearchDocument`'s dictionary indexer.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L151-L157 -->
```Java
SearchPagedIterable searchResultsIterable = searchClient.search("luxury");
for (SearchResult searchResult: searchResultsIterable) {
    SearchDocument doc = searchResult.getDocument(SearchDocument.class);
    String id = (String) doc.get("hotelId");
    String name = (String) doc.get("hotelName");
    System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", id, name);
}
```

#### Use Java model class
Define a `Hotel` class.
<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L160-L181 -->
```Java
public class Hotel {
    private String id;
    private String name;

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public Hotel setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
        return this;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Hotel setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        return this;
    }
}
```

And use them in place of `SearchDocument` when querying.
<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L184-L190 -->
```Java
SearchPagedIterable searchResultsIterable = searchClient.search("luxury");
for (SearchResult searchResult: searchResultsIterable) {
    Hotel doc = searchResult.getDocument(Hotel.class);
    String id = doc.getId();
    String name = doc.getName();
    System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", id, name);
}
```

If you're working with a search index and know the schema, creating Java model class
is recommended.

#### Search Options

The `SearchOptions` provide powerful control over the behavior of our queries.
Let's search for the top 5 luxury hotels with a good rating.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L194-L200 -->
```Java 
int stars = 4;
SearchOptions options = new SearchOptions()
    .setFilter(String.format("rating ge %s", stars))
    .setOrderBy("rating desc")
    .setTop(5);
SearchPagedIterable searchResultsIterable = searchClient.search("luxury", options, Context.NONE);
// ...
```

### Creating an index

You can use the [`SearchIndexClient`](#Create-a-SearchIndexClient) to create a search index. Fields can be
defined using convenient `SimpleField`, `SearchableField`, or `ComplexField`
classes. Indexes can also define suggesters, lexical analyzers, and more.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L226-L276 -->
```Java
        searchFieldList.add(new SimpleFieldBuilder("hotelId", SearchFieldDataType.STRING, false)
            .setKey(true)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setSortable(true)
            .build());
        searchFieldList.add(new SearchableFieldBuilder("hotelName", false)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setSortable(true)
            .build());
        searchFieldList.add(new SearchableFieldBuilder("description", false)
            .setAnalyzerName(LexicalAnalyzerName.EU_LUCENE)
            .build());
        searchFieldList.add(new SearchableFieldBuilder("tags", true)
            .setKey(true)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setFacetable(true)
            .build());
        searchFieldList.add(new ComplexFieldBuilder("address", false)
            .setFields(Arrays.asList(
                new SearchableFieldBuilder("streetAddress", false).build(),
                new SearchableFieldBuilder("city", false)
                    .setFilterable(true)
                    .setFacetable(true)
                    .setSortable(true)
                    .build(),
                new SearchableFieldBuilder("stateProvince", false)
                    .setFilterable(true)
                    .setFacetable(true)
                    .setSortable(true)
                    .build(),
                new SearchableFieldBuilder("country", false)
                    .setFilterable(true)
                    .setFacetable(true)
                    .setSortable(true)
                    .build(),
                new SearchableFieldBuilder("postalCode", false)
                    .setFilterable(true)
                    .setFacetable(true)
                    .setSortable(true)
                    .build()
            ))
            .build());
        // Prepare suggester.
        SearchSuggester suggester = new SearchSuggester("sg", Collections.singletonList("hotelName"));
        // Prepare SearchIndex with index name and search fields.
        SearchIndex index = new SearchIndex("hotels").setFields(searchFieldList).setSuggesters(
            Collections.singletonList(suggester));
        // Create an index
        searchIndexClient.createIndex(index);
    }
}
```

### Retrieving a specific document from your index

In addition to querying for documents using keywords and optional filters,
you can retrieve a specific document from your index if you already know the
key. You could get the key from a query, for example, and want to show more
information about it or navigate your customer to that document.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L212-L213 -->
```Java 
Hotel hotel = searchClient.getDocument("1", Hotel.class);
System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", hotel.getId(), hotel.getName());
```

### Adding documents to your index

You can `Upload`, `Merge`, `MergeOrUpload`, and `Delete` multiple documents from
an index in a single batched request.  There are
[a few special rules for merging](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents#document-actions)
to be aware of.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L217-L220 -->
```Java
IndexDocumentsBatch<Hotel> batch = new IndexDocumentsBatch<Hotel>();
batch.addUploadActions(new Hotel().setId("783").setName("Upload Inn"));
batch.addMergeActions(new Hotel().setId("12").setName("Renovated Ranch"));
searchClient.indexDocuments(batch);
```

The request will throw `IndexBatchException` by default if any of the individual actions fail, and you can use 
`findFailedActionsToRetry` to retry on failed documents.
There's also a `ThrowOnAnyError` option, and you can set it to `false` to get a successful response
with an `IndexDocumentsResult` for inspection.


### Async APIs

All of the examples so far have been using synchronous APIs, but we provide full
support for async APIs as well. You'll need to use [SearchAsyncClient](#Create-a-SearchClient)

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L204-L209 -->
```Java
    searchAsyncClient.search("luxury")
        .subscribe(result -> {
            Hotel hotel = result.getDocument(Hotel.class);
            System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", hotel.getId(), hotel.getName());
        });
}
```

**Samples are explained in detail [here][samples_readme].**

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with Azure Cognitive Search using this Java client library, errors returned by the service correspond 
to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][rest_api] requests. For example, if you try to retrieve a document 
that doesn't exist in your index, a `404` error is returned, indicating `Not Found`.

### Handling Search Error Response

Any Search API operation that fails will throw a
[`HttpResponseException`][HttpResponseException] with
helpful [`Status codes`][status_codes].  Many of these errors are recoverable.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L110-L118 -->
```Java
try {
    Iterable<SearchResult> results = searchClient.search("hotel");
} catch (HttpResponseException ex) {
    // The exception contains the HTTP status code and the detailed message
    // returned from the search service
    HttpResponse response = ex.getResponse();
    System.out.println("Status Code: " + response.getStatusCode());
    System.out.println("Message: " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

You can also easily [enable console logging][logging] if you want to dig
deeper into the requests you're making against the service.

### Enabling Logging

Azure SDKs for Java offer a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite 
their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help 
locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Default HTTP Client

By default a Netty based HTTP client will be used, for more information on configuring or changing the HTTP client is 
detailed in the [HTTP clients wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/HTTP-clients).
