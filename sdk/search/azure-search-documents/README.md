# Azure Cognitive Search client library for Java

This is the Java client library for [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/).
Azure Cognitive Search service is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding
a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

The Azure Cognitive Search service is well suited for the following application scenarios:

* Consolidate varied content types into a single searchable index. To populate an index, you can push JSON documents
that contain your content, or if your data is already in Azure, create an indexer to pull in data automatically.

* Attach skillsets to an indexer to create searchable content from images and large text documents. A skillset leverages
AI from Cognitive Services for built-in OCR, entity recognition, key phrase extraction, language detection, text
translation, and sentiment analysis. You can also add custom skills to integrate external processing of your content
during data ingestion.

* In a search client application, implement query logic and user experiences similar to commercial web search engines.

Use the Azure Cognitive Search client library to:

* Submit queries for simple and advanced query forms that include fuzzy search, wildcard search, regular expressions.
* Implement filtered queries for faceted navigation, geospatial search, or to narrow results based on filter criteria.
* Create and manage search indexes.
* Upload and update documents in the search index.
* Create and manage indexers that pull data from Azure into an index.
* Create and manage skillsets that add AI enrichment to data ingestion.
* Create and manage analyzers for advanced text analysis or multi-lingual content.
* Optimize results through scoring profiles to factor in business logic or freshness.

## Getting started

### Include the package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-search-documents;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-search-documents</artifactId>
    <version>11.3.2</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Prerequisites

* [Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above][jdk]
* [Azure subscription][azure_subscription]
* [Azure Cognitive Search service][search]
* To create a new search service, you can use the [Azure portal][create_search_service_docs],
[Azure PowerShell][create_search_service_ps], or the [Azure CLI][create_search_service_cli].
Here's an example using the Azure CLI to create a free instance for getting started:

```bash
az search service create --name <mysearch> --resource-group <mysearch-rg> --sku free --location westus
```

See [choosing a pricing tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-sku-tier) for more information about available options.

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Azure Cognitive Search service you'll need to create an instance of the Search Client class.
To make this possible you will need,

1. [URL endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal#get-a-key-and-url-endpoint)
1. [API key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-create-service-portal#get-a-key-and-url-endpoint)

for your service. [The api-key is the sole mechanism for authenticating access to
your search service endpoint.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-security-api-keys)
You can obtain your api-key from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or via the Azure CLI:

```bash
az search admin-key show --service-name <mysearch> --resource-group <mysearch-rg>
```

**Note:**

* The example Azure CLI snippet above retrieves an admin key. This allows for easier access when exploring APIs,
but it should be managed carefully.
* There are two types of keys used to access your search service: **admin** *(read-write)* and **query** *(read-only)*
keys. Restricting access and operations in client apps is essential to safeguarding the search assets on your service.
Always use a query key rather than an admin key for any query originating from a client app.

The SDK provides three clients.

* `SearchIndexClient` for CRUD operations on indexes and synonym maps.
* `SearchIndexerClient` for CRUD operations on indexers, date sources, and skillsets.
* `SearchClient` for all document operations.

#### Create a SearchIndexClient

To create a `SearchIndexClient/SearchIndexAsyncClient`, you will need the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service
URL endpoint and admin key.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L66-L69 -->
```java
SearchIndexClient searchIndexClient = new SearchIndexClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L73-L76 -->
```java
SearchIndexAsyncClient searchIndexAsyncClient = new SearchIndexClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

#### Create a SearchIndexerClient

To create a `SearchIndexerClient/SearchIndexerAsyncClient`, you will need the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service
URL endpoint and admin key.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L80-L83 -->
```java
SearchIndexerClient searchIndexerClient = new SearchIndexerClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L87-L90 -->
```java
SearchIndexerAsyncClient searchIndexerAsyncClient = new SearchIndexerClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

#### Create a SearchClient

Once you have the values of the Azure Cognitive Search service URL endpoint and
admin key, you can create the `SearchClient/SearchAsyncClient` with an existing index name:

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L50-L54 -->
```java
SearchClient searchClient = new SearchClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(adminKey))
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildClient();
```

or

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L58-L62 -->
```java
SearchAsyncClient searchAsyncClient = new SearchClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(adminKey))
    .indexName(indexName)
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

### Send your first search query

To get running with Azure Cognitive Search first create an index following this [guide][search-get-started-portal].
With an index created you can use the following samples to begin using the SDK.

## Key concepts

An Azure Cognitive Search service contains one or more indexes that provide persistent storage of searchable data in
the form of JSON documents. _(If you're new to search, you can make a very rough analogy between indexes and database
tables.)_ The `azure-search-documents` client library exposes operations on these resources through two main client types.

* `SearchClient` helps with:
  * [Searching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-lucene-query-architecture)
    your indexed documents using
    [rich queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-query-overview)
    and [powerful data shaping](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-filters)
  * [Autocompleting](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/autocomplete)
    partially typed search terms based on documents in the index
  * [Suggesting](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/suggestions)
    the most likely matching text in documents as a user types
  * [Adding, Updating or Deleting Documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents)
    documents from an index

* `SearchIndexClient` allows you to:
  * [Create, delete, update, or configure a search index](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/index-operations)
  * [Declare custom synonym maps to expand or rewrite queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/synonym-map-operations)
  * Most of the `SearchServiceClient` functionality is not yet available in our current preview

* `SearchIndexerClient` allows you to:
  * [Start indexers to automatically crawl data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/indexer-operations)
  * [Define AI powered Skillsets to transform and enrich your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/skillset-operations)

## Examples

The following examples all use a simple [Hotel data set](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/azure-search-sample-data/azure-search-sample-data/)
that you can [import into your own index from the Azure portal.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-portal#step-1---start-the-import-data-wizard-and-create-a-data-source)
These are just a few of the basics - please [check out our Samples][samples_readme] for much more.

### Querying

There are two ways to interact with the data returned from a search query.

Let's explore them with a search for a "luxury" hotel.

#### Use `SearchDocument` like a dictionary for search results

`SearchDocument` is the default type returned from queries when you don't provide your own.  Here we perform the search,
enumerate over the results, and extract data using `SearchDocument`'s dictionary indexer.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L122-L127 -->
```java
for (SearchResult searchResult : searchClient.search("luxury")) {
    SearchDocument doc = searchResult.getDocument(SearchDocument.class);
    String id = (String) doc.get("hotelId");
    String name = (String) doc.get("hotelName");
    System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", id, name);
}
```

#### Use Java model class for search results

Define a `Hotel` class.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L130-L151 -->
```java
public class Hotel {
    private String id;
    private String name;

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public Hotel setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
        return this;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Hotel setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        return this;
    }
}
```

Use it in place of `SearchDocument` when querying.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L154-L159 -->
```java
for (SearchResult searchResult : searchClient.search("luxury")) {
    Hotel doc = searchResult.getDocument(Hotel.class);
    String id = doc.getId();
    String name = doc.getName();
    System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", id, name);
}
```

It is recommended, when you know the schema of the search index, to create a Java model class.

#### Search Options

The `SearchOptions` provide powerful control over the behavior of our queries.

Let's search for the top 5 luxury hotels with a good rating.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L163-L168 -->
```java
SearchOptions options = new SearchOptions()
    .setFilter("rating ge 4")
    .setOrderBy("rating desc")
    .setTop(5);
SearchPagedIterable searchResultsIterable = searchClient.search("luxury", options, Context.NONE);
// ...
```

### Creating an index

You can use the [`SearchIndexClient`](#create-a-searchindexclient) to create a search index. Indexes can also define
suggesters, lexical analyzers, and more.

There are multiple ways of preparing search fields for a search index. For basic needs, we provide a static helper method
`buildSearchFields` in `SearchIndexClient` and `SearchIndexAsyncClient`, which can convert Java POJO class into
`List<SearchField>`. There are three annotations `SimpleFieldProperty`, `SearchFieldProperty` and `FieldBuilderIgnore`
to configure the field of model class.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L242-L243 -->
```java
List<SearchField> searchFields = SearchIndexClient.buildSearchFields(Hotel.class, null);
searchIndexClient.createIndex(new SearchIndex("index", searchFields));
```

For advanced scenarios, we can build search fields using `SearchField` directly.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L192-L238 -->
```java
List<SearchField> searchFieldList = new ArrayList<>();
searchFieldList.add(new SearchField("hotelId", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
    .setKey(true)
    .setFilterable(true)
    .setSortable(true));

searchFieldList.add(new SearchField("hotelName", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
    .setSearchable(true)
    .setFilterable(true)
    .setSortable(true));
searchFieldList.add(new SearchField("description", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
    .setSearchable(true)
    .setAnalyzerName(LexicalAnalyzerName.EU_LUCENE));
searchFieldList.add(new SearchField("tags", SearchFieldDataType.collection(SearchFieldDataType.STRING))
    .setSearchable(true)
    .setFilterable(true)
    .setFacetable(true));
searchFieldList.add(new SearchField("address", SearchFieldDataType.COMPLEX)
    .setFields(new SearchField("streetAddress", SearchFieldDataType.STRING).setSearchable(true),
        new SearchField("city", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
            .setSearchable(true)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setFacetable(true)
            .setSortable(true),
        new SearchField("stateProvince", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
            .setSearchable(true)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setFacetable(true)
            .setSortable(true),
        new SearchField("country", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
            .setSearchable(true)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setFacetable(true)
            .setSortable(true),
        new SearchField("postalCode", SearchFieldDataType.STRING)
            .setSearchable(true)
            .setFilterable(true)
            .setFacetable(true)
            .setSortable(true)
    ));

// Prepare suggester.
SearchSuggester suggester = new SearchSuggester("sg", Collections.singletonList("hotelName"));
// Prepare SearchIndex with index name and search fields.
SearchIndex index = new SearchIndex("hotels").setFields(searchFieldList).setSuggesters(suggester);
// Create an index
searchIndexClient.createIndex(index);
```

### Retrieving a specific document from your index

In addition to querying for documents using keywords and optional filters, you can retrieve a specific document from
your index if you already know the key. You could get the key from a query, for example, and want to show more
information about it or navigate your customer to that document.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L180-L181 -->
```java
Hotel hotel = searchClient.getDocument("1", Hotel.class);
System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", hotel.getId(), hotel.getName());
```

### Adding documents to your index

You can `Upload`, `Merge`, `MergeOrUpload`, and `Delete` multiple documents from an index in a single batched request.
There are [a few special rules for merging](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents#document-actions)
to be aware of.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L185-L188 -->
```java
IndexDocumentsBatch<Hotel> batch = new IndexDocumentsBatch<>();
batch.addUploadActions(Collections.singletonList(new Hotel().setId("783").setName("Upload Inn")));
batch.addMergeActions(Collections.singletonList(new Hotel().setId("12").setName("Renovated Ranch")));
searchClient.indexDocuments(batch);
```

The request will throw `IndexBatchException` by default if any of the individual actions fail, and you can use
`findFailedActionsToRetry` to retry on failed documents. There's also a `throwOnAnyError` option, and you can set it
to `false` to get a successful response with an `IndexDocumentsResult` for inspection.

### Async APIs

The examples so far have been using synchronous APIs, but we provide full support for async APIs as well. You'll need
to use [SearchAsyncClient](#create-a-searchclient).

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L172-L176 -->
```java
searchAsyncClient.search("luxury")
    .subscribe(result -> {
        Hotel hotel = result.getDocument(Hotel.class);
        System.out.printf("This is hotelId %s, and this is hotel name %s.%n", hotel.getId(), hotel.getName());
    });
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with Azure Cognitive Search using this Java client library, errors returned by the service correspond
to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][rest_api] requests. For example, the service will return a `404`
error if you try to retrieve a document that doesn't exist in your index.

### Handling Search Error Response

Any Search API operation that fails will throw an [`HttpResponseException`][HttpResponseException] with helpful
[`Status codes`][status_codes]. Many of these errors are recoverable.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/search/documents/ReadmeSamples.java#L110-L118 -->
```java
try {
    Iterable<SearchResult> results = searchClient.search("hotel");
} catch (HttpResponseException ex) {
    // The exception contains the HTTP status code and the detailed message
    // returned from the search service
    HttpResponse response = ex.getResponse();
    System.out.println("Status Code: " + response.getStatusCode());
    System.out.println("Message: " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

You can also easily [enable console logging][logging] if you want to dig deeper into the requests you're making against
the service.

### Enabling Logging

Azure SDKs for Java provide a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite
their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help
locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Default HTTP Client

By default, a Netty based HTTP client will be used. The [HTTP clients wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/HTTP-clients)
provides more information on configuring or changing the HTTP client.
