# Azure GraalVM Support client library for Java

> **IMPORTANT** Please note that this package is deprecated and will no longer be updated. The necessary configuration files to support
> native image compilation using GraalVM is now directly available on respective client libraries. It is no longer required
> to add this package as a dependency to build native images with Azure SDK for Java.
> Please refer to the [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/announcing-graalvm-support-in-azure-sdk-for-java-and-spring-cloud-azure-libraries/) for more details on GraalVM support in Azure SDK for Java.
 
The Azure GraalVM Support client library provides support for applications using [Azure client libraries](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/java.html) to be built as [GraalVM native
images](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/). The library contains all the necessary
[configuration files](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/) and [GraalVM
features](https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/index.html?org/graalvm/nativeimage/hosted/Feature.html) required to build
a native image of an application that uses Azure client libraries.

**NOTE:**: This library is a preview and is intended to enable applications using Azure client libraries to quickly
build and validate native images. However, this is not a stable, GA version and is not officially supported to use in production
environments.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- A [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link], version 8 or later.
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) version 22 or later.
- [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/)

For more details, please refer to [Getting started with GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/docs/getting-started/)
documentation.

### Include the package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-aot-graalvm-support;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-aot-graalvm-support</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.3</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

Also, include the `azure-aot-graalvm-support-netty` package to bring in the configuration files required for Netty HTTP
client.  For more details on this library, please refer to [this README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/aot/azure-aot-graalvm-support-netty/README.md).

## Key concepts

### Native Image creation

Native Image is a technology to compile your Java application ahead of time into a native image which can run as a
standalone application. The native image created through this ahead-of-time compilation will include all the
necessary classes from the application, it's dependencies and any other natively linked JDK code. For more details
on creating the native image please refer to [building a native image](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/#build-a-native-image) documentation.

### GraalVM configuration files

GraalVM is a high-performance runtime that creates native images by compiling the Java code ahead of time. Due to
this ahead-of-time compilation into a native image, the native image creation requires statically analyzing all
classes of the application and their dependencies to determine which classes and methods are reachable during the
application execution. However, there are scenarios where Java allows looking up classes, methods and fields at
runtime through reflection. While GraalVM does a best-effort discovery of all classes ahead of time, it will not be
able to detect all classes that are reflectively accessed. So, developers can provide configuration files that
contain details of all necessary classes that are reflectively accessed. This supplementary information is then used
to create the native image and make these classes available at runtime.

This library provides all the necessary configuration files for using Azure client libraries.

library consists of all above samples bundled into a single Maven project that can be compiled with `mvn clean
install -Pnative` to build the native image and execute all the samples.
