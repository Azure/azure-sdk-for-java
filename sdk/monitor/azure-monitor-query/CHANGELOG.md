# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.1 (2021-06-09)
Version 1.0.0-beta.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library for querying Azure Monitor logs and 
metrics that is developer-friendly, idiomatic to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages 
and platforms as possible. The principles that guide our efforts can be found in the
[Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).

## Features Added
- Initial release. Please see the README and wiki for information on using the new library.
