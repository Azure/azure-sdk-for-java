Version 1.0.0-beta.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library for querying Azure Monitor logs and

and platforms as possible. The principles that guide our efforts can be found in the
[Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).

### Features Added
- Initial release. Please see the README and wiki for information on using the new library.
