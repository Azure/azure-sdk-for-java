# Azure Monitor query client library for Java

Azure Monitor helps you maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services. It delivers a
comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.

All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types, metrics and logs. Metrics are numerical
values that describe some aspect of a system at a particular point in time. They are lightweight and capable of
supporting near real-time scenarios. Logs contain different kinds of data organized into records with different sets of
properties for each type. Telemetry such as events and traces are stored as logs in addition to performance data so that
it can all be combined for analysis.

This client library provides access to query metrics and logs collected by Azure Monitor.

## Key concepts

### Logs

Azure Monitor Logs is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects and organizes log and performance data from monitored
resources. Data from different sources such as platform logs from Azure services, log and performance data from virtual
machines agents, and usage and performance data from applications can be consolidated into a single workspace so they
can be analyzed together using a sophisticated query language that's capable of quickly analyzing millions of records.
You may perform a simple query that just retrieves a specific set of records or perform sophisticated data analysis to
identify critical patterns in your monitoring data.

#### Log Analytics workspaces

Data collected by Azure Monitor Logs is stored in one or more Log Analytics workspaces. The workspace defines the
geographic location of the data, access rights defining which users can access data, and configuration settings such as
the pricing tier and data retention.

You must create at least one workspace to use Azure Monitor Logs. A single workspace may be sufficient for all of your
monitoring data, or may choose to create multiple workspaces depending on your requirements. For example, you might have
one workspace for your production data and another for testing.

#### Logs queries

Data is retrieved from a Log Analytics workspace using a log query which is a read-only request to process data and
return results. Log queries are written
in [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/), which is the same query
language used by Azure Data Explorer. You can write log queries in Log Analytics to interactively analyze their results,
use them in alert rules to be proactively notified of issues, or include their results in workbooks or dashboards.
Insights include prebuilt queries to support their views and workbooks.

#### Logs query rate limits and throttling

Each AAD user is able to make up to 200 requests per 30 seconds, with no cap on the total calls per day.If requests are 
being made at a rate higher than this, then these requests will receive HTTP status code 429 
(Too Many Requests) along with the Retry-After: <delta-seconds> header which indicates the number of seconds until 
requests to this application are likely to be accepted.

As well as call rate limits and daily quota caps, there are also limits on queries themselves:

- Queries cannot return more than 500,000 rows
- Queries cannot return more than 64,000,000 bytes (~61 MiB total data)
- Queries cannot run longer than 10 minutes by default. See this for details.

### Metrics

Azure Monitor Metrics is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data from monitored resources into a time
series database. Metrics are numerical values that are collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a
system at a particular time. Metrics in Azure Monitor are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios
making them particularly useful for alerting and fast detection of issues. You can analyze them interactively with
metrics explorer, be proactively notified with an alert when a value crosses a threshold, or visualize them in a
workbook or dashboard.

#### Metrics data structure

Data collected by Azure Monitor Metrics is stored in a time-series database which is optimized for analyzing
time-stamped data. Each set of metric values is a time series with the following properties:

- The time the value was collected
- The resource the value is associated with
- A namespace that acts like a category for the metric
- A metric name
- The value itself
- Some metrics may have multiple dimensions as described in Multi-dimensional metrics. Custom metrics can have up to 10
  dimensions.

### Get logs for a query

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L65-L74 -->
```java
LogsQueryClient logsQueryClient = new LogsQueryClientBuilder()
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
        .buildClient();

LogsQueryResult queryResults = logsQueryClient.query("{workspace-id}", "{kusto-query}",
        new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(2)));

for (LogsTableRow row : queryResults.getTable().getRows()) {
    System.out.println(row.getColumnValue("OperationName") + " " + row.getColumnValue("ResourceGroup"));
}
```

### Get logs for a query and read the response as a model type

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L80-L91 -->
```java
public class CustomLogModel {
    private String resourceGroup;
    private String operationName;

    public String getResourceGroup() {
        return resourceGroup;
    }

    public String getOperationName() {
        return operationName;
    }
}
```
<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L97-L106 -->
```java
LogsQueryClient logsQueryClient = new LogsQueryClientBuilder()
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
        .buildClient();

List<CustomLogModel> customLogModels = logsQueryClient.query("{workspace-id}", "{kusto-query}",
        new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(2)), CustomLogModel.class);

for (CustomLogModel customLogModel : customLogModels) {
    System.out.println(customLogModel.getOperationName() + " " + customLogModel.getResourceGroup());
}
```
### Get logs for a batch of queries

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L113-L138 -->
```java
LogsQueryClient logsQueryClient = new LogsQueryClientBuilder()
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
        .buildClient();

LogsBatchQuery logsBatchQuery = new LogsBatchQuery();
String query1 = logsBatchQuery.addQuery("{workspace-id}", "{query-1}", new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(2)));
String query2 = logsBatchQuery.addQuery("{workspace-id}", "{query-2}", new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(30)));
String query3 = logsBatchQuery.addQuery("{workspace-id}", "{query-3}", new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(10)));

LogsBatchQueryResultCollection batchResults = logsQueryClient
        .queryBatchWithResponse(logsBatchQuery, Context.NONE).getValue();

LogsBatchQueryResult query1Result = batchResults.getResult(query1);
for (LogsTableRow row : query1Result.getTable().getRows()) {
    System.out.println(row.getColumnValue("OperationName") + " " + row.getColumnValue("ResourceGroup"));
}

List<CustomLogModel> customLogModels = batchResults.getResult(query2, CustomLogModel.class);
for (CustomLogModel customLogModel : customLogModels) {
    System.out.println(customLogModel.getOperationName() + " " + customLogModel.getResourceGroup());
}

LogsBatchQueryResult query3Result = batchResults.getResult(query3);
if (query3Result.hasFailed()) {
    System.out.println(query3Result.getError().getMessage());
}
```

### Get logs for a query with server timeout

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L146-L155 -->
```java
LogsQueryClient logsQueryClient = new LogsQueryClientBuilder()
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildClient();

// set request options: server timeout
LogsQueryOptions options = new LogsQueryOptions()
    .setServerTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(10));

Response<LogsQueryResult> response = logsQueryClient.queryWithResponse("{workspace-id}",
        "{kusto-query}", new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(2)), options, Context.NONE);
```

### Get logs from multiple workspaces

When multiple workspaces are included in the query, the logs in the result table are not grouped according to the 
workspace from which it was retrieved. To identify the workspace of a row in the result table, you can inspect the 
"TenantId" column in the result table. If this column is not in the table, then you may have to update your query string
to include this column.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L162-L170 -->
```java
LogsQueryClient logsQueryClient = new LogsQueryClientBuilder()
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
        .buildClient();

Response<LogsQueryResult> response = logsQueryClient.queryWithResponse("{workspace-id}", "{kusto-query}",
        new TimeInterval(Duration.ofDays(2)), new LogsQueryOptions()
                .setAdditionalWorkspaces(Arrays.asList("{additional-workspace-identifiers}")),
        Context.NONE);
LogsQueryResult result = response.getValue();
```

#### Response structure for Logs Query

The `query` API returns the `LogsQueryResult` while the `queryBatch` API returns the `LogsBatchQueryResult`.

Here is a hierarchy of the response:

```
LogsQueryResult / LogsBatchQueryResult
|---id (this exists in `LogsBatchQueryResult` object only)
|---status (this exists in `LogsBatchQueryResult` object only)
|---statistics
|---visualization
|---error
|---tables (list of `LogsTable` objects)
    |---name
    |---rows (list of `LogsTableRow` objects)
        |--- rowIndex
        |--- rowCells (list of `LogsTableCell` objects)
    |---columns (list of `LogsTableColumn` objects)
        |---name
        |---type
```

### Get metrics

A resource ID, as denoted by the `{resource-id}` placeholder in the sample below, is required to query metrics. To find the resource ID:

1. Navigate to your resource's page in the Azure portal.
2. From the **Overview** blade, select the **JSON View** link.
3. In the resulting JSON, copy the value of the `id` property.

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L178-L193 -->
```java
MetricsQueryClient metricsQueryClient = new MetricsQueryClientBuilder()
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
        .buildClient();

MetricsQueryResult metricsQueryResult = metricsQueryClient.query("{resource-uri}",
        Arrays.asList("SuccessfulCalls", "TotalCalls"));

for (MetricResult metric : metricsQueryResult.getMetrics()) {
    System.out.println("Metric name " + metric.getMetricName());
    for (TimeSeriesElement timeSeriesElement : metric.getTimeSeries()) {
        System.out.println("Dimensions " + timeSeriesElement.getMetadata());
        for (MetricValue metricValue : timeSeriesElement.getValues()) {
            System.out.println(metricValue.getTimeStamp() + " " + metricValue.getTotal());
        }
    }
}
```

### Get average and count metrics

<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/monitor/query/ReadmeSamples.java#L200-L221 -->
```java
MetricsQueryClient metricsQueryClient = new MetricsQueryClientBuilder()
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildClient();

Response<MetricsQueryResult> metricsResponse = metricsQueryClient
    .queryWithResponse("{resource-id}", Arrays.asList("SuccessfulCalls", "TotalCalls"),
        new MetricsQueryOptions()
            .setGranularity(Duration.ofHours(1))
            .setAggregations(Arrays.asList(AggregationType.AVERAGE, AggregationType.COUNT)),
        Context.NONE);

MetricsQueryResult metricsQueryResult = metricsResponse.getValue();

for (MetricResult metric : metricsQueryResult.getMetrics()) {
    System.out.println("Metric name " + metric.getMetricName());
    for (TimeSeriesElement timeSeriesElement : metric.getTimeSeries()) {
        System.out.println("Dimensions " + timeSeriesElement.getMetadata());
        for (MetricValue metricValue : timeSeriesElement.getValues()) {
            System.out.println(metricValue.getTimeStamp() + " " + metricValue.getTotal());
        }
    }
}
```
### Response structure for Metrics query

The metrics query API returns a `MetricsQueryResult` object. The `MetricsQueryResult` object contains properties such as a 
list of `MetricResult`-typed objects, `granularity`, `namespace`, and `timeInterval`. The `MetricResult` objects list 
can be accessed using the `metrics` param. Each `MetricResult` object in this list contains a list of `TimeSeriesElement` objects. 
Each `TimeSeriesElement` contains `data` and `metadata_values` properties. The `MetricResult` list is ordered 
according to the list of metrics names provided in the request. In visual form, the object hierarchy of the 
response resembles the following structure:

```
MetricsQueryResult
|---granularity
|---timeInterval
|---cost
|---namespace
|---resourceRegion
|---metrics (list of `MetricResult` objects)
    |---id
    |---type
    |---name
    |---unit
    |---timeSeries (list of `TimeSeriesElement` objects)
        |---metadata (dimensions)
        |---metricValues (list of data points represented by `MetricValue` objects)
             |--- timeStamp
             |--- count
             |--- average
             |--- total
             |--- maximum
             |--- minimum
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable client logging

You can set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to view logging statements made in the client library. For
example, setting `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL=2` would show all informational, warning, and error log messages. The log levels can
be found here: [log levels][log_levels].

### Default HTTP Client

All client libraries by default use the Netty HTTP client. Adding the above dependency will automatically configure the
client library to use the Netty HTTP client. Configuring or changing the HTTP client is detailed in the
[HTTP clients wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/HTTP-clients).

### Default SSL library

All client libraries, by default, use the Tomcat-native Boring SSL library to enable native-level performance for SSL
operations. The Boring SSL library is an uber jar containing native libraries for Linux / macOS / Windows, and provides
better performance compared to the default SSL com.azure.monitor.collect.metrics.implementation within the JDK. For more information, including how to
reduce the dependency size, refer to the [performance tuning][performance_tuning] section of the wiki.
