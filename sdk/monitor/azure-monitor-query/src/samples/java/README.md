# Azure Monitor Logs and Metrics query client library samples for Java

Azure Monitor query samples are a set of self-contained Java programs that demonstrate interacting with Azure self
-contained service using the client library. Each sample focuses on a specific scenario and can be executed independently.

## Key concepts

Key concepts are explained in detail [here][SDK_README_KEY_CONCEPTS].

## Getting started

Getting started explained in detail [here][SDK_README_GETTING_STARTED].

## Examples

The following sections provide code samples covering common operations with OpenTelemetry Azure Monitor Exporter client
library.

* [Get logs for a query][get_logs]
* [Get logs for a batch for queries][get_batch_logs]
* [Get logs for a query with server timeout][get_servertimeout_logs]
* [Get metrics][get_metrics]

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting steps can be found [here][SDK_README_TROUBLESHOOTING].
