# Azure Schema Registry library samples for Java

Azure Schema Registry samples are a set of self-contained Java programs that demonstrate using the client library to
register schemas with Azure Schema Registry service and read from it. Each sample focuses on a specific scenario and
can be executed independently.

## Key concepts
Key concepts are explained in detail [here][sdk_readme_key_concepts].

## Getting started
