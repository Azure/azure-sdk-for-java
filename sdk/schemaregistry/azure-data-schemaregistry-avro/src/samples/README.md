# Azure Schema Registry serializer library samples for Java

Azure Schema Registry Avro Serializer samples are a set of self-contained Java programs that demonstrate serialization 
and deserialization of data for which the schema is stored in Schema Registry service. Each sample focuses on a 
specific scenario and can be executed independently.

## Key concepts
Key concepts are explained in detail [here][sdk_readme_key_concepts].

## Getting started
Please refer to the [Getting Started][sdk_readme_getting_started] section.

## Examples

- [Serialize an object into avro schema bytes][sample_avro_serialization]
- [Deserialize avro serialized bytes into a strongly-typed object][sample_avro_deserialization]

## Troubleshooting
See [Troubleshooting][sdk_readme_troubleshooting].

## Next steps
See [Next steps][sdk_readme_next_steps].

## Contributing
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. See [Contributing][sdk_readme_contributing] for guidelines.
