# Spring Cloud Azure Stream Binder for Service Bus queue Sample shared library for Java

## Key concepts

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Spring Cloud Stream binder for 
Azure Service Bus queue. The sample app has two operating modes.
One way is to expose a Restful API to receive string message, another way is to automatically provide string messages.
These messages are published to a service bus queue. The sample will also consume messages from the same service bus queue.

## Getting started

Running this sample will be charged by Azure. You can check the usage and bill at 
[this link][azure-account].

### Environment checklist

We need to ensure that this [environment checklist][ready-to-run-checklist] is 
completed before the run.

### Create Azure resources

We have several ways to config the Spring Cloud Stream Binder for Service
Bus Queue. You can choose anyone of them.

>[!Important]
>
>  When using the Restful API to send messages, the **Active profiles** must contain `manual`.

#### Method 1: Connection string based usage

1.  Create Azure Service Bus namespace and queue.
    Please see [how to create][create-service-bus].

1.  Update [application.yaml][application.yaml].
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          servicebus:
            connection-string: [servicebus-namespace-connection-string] 
        stream:
          bindings: 
            consume-in-0: 
              destination: [servicebus-queue-name]
            supply-out-0:
              destination: [servicebus-queue-name-same-as-above]
          function:
            definition: consume;supply;
          poller:
            fixed-delay: 1000
            initial-delay: 0
    ```

#### Method 2: Service principal based usage

1.  Create a service principal for use in by your app. Please follow 
    [create service principal from Azure CLI][create-sp-using-azure-cli].

1.  Create Azure Service Bus namespace and queue.
        Please see [how to create][create-service-bus].

1.  Add Role Assignment for Service Bus. See
    [Service principal for Azure resources with Service Bus][role-assignment]
    to add role assignment for Service Bus. Assign `Contributor` role for service bus.
    
1.  Update [application-sp.yaml][application-sp.yaml].
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          client-id: [service-principal-id]
          client-secret: [service-principal-secret]
          tenant-id: [tenant-id]
          resource-group: [resource-group]
          servicebus:
            namespace: [servicebus-namespace]
        stream:
          bindings:
            consume-in-0:
              destination: [servicebus-queue-name]
            supply-out-0:
              destination: [servicebus-queue-name-same-as-above]
          function:
            definition: consume;supply;
          poller:
            fixed-delay: 1000
            initial-delay: 0
    ```
#### Method 3: MSI credential based usage

##### Set up managed identity

Please follow [create managed identity][create-managed-identity] to set up managed identity.

##### Create other Azure resources

1.  Create Azure Service Bus namespace and queue.
        Please see [how to create][create-service-bus].
        
1.  Add Role Assignment for Service Bus. See
    [Managed identities for Azure resources with Service Bus][role-assignment]
    to add role assignment for Service Bus. Assign `Contributor` role for managed identity.
    

##### Update MSI related properties

1.  Update [application-mi.yaml][application-mi.yaml].
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          msi-enabled: true
          client-id: [the-id-of-managed-identity]
          resource-group: [resource-group]
          subscription-id: [subscription-id]
          servicebus:
            namespace: [servicebus-namespace]
        stream:
          bindings:
            consume-in-0:
              destination: [servicebus-queue-name]
            supply-out-0:
              destination: [servicebus-queue-name-same-as-above]
          function:
            definition: consume;supply;
          poller:
            fixed-delay: 1000
            initial-delay: 0
    ```
    > We should specify `spring.profiles.active=mi` to run the Spring Boot application. 
      For App Service, please add a configuration entry for this.

##### Redeploy Application

If you update the `spring.cloud.azure.managed-identity.client-id`
property after deploying the app, or update the role assignment for
services, please try to redeploy the app again.

> You can follow 
> [Deploy a Spring Boot JAR file to Azure App Service][deploy-spring-boot-application-to-app-service] 
> to deploy this application to App Service

#### Enable auto create

If you want to auto create the Azure Service Bus instances, make sure you add such properties 
(only support the service principal and managed identity cases):

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    azure:
      subscription-id: [subscription-id]
      auto-create-resources: true
      environment: Azure
      region: [region]
```


## Examples

1.  Run the `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

1.  Send a POST request

        $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages?message=hello

    or when the app runs on App Service or VM

        $ curl -d -X POST https://[your-app-URL]/messages?message=hello

1.  Verify in your app’s logs that a similar message was posted:

        New message received: 'hello'
        Message 'hello' successfully checkpointed

1.  Delete the resources on [Azure Portal][azure-portal] to avoid unexpected charges.
