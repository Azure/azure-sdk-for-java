/**
 * The AttestationClient implements the functionality required by the "Attest" family of APIs.
 * <p>
 * An enclave (or Trusted Execution Environment) is a chunk of code that is isolated from the host
 * (think: "encrypted VM" or "encrypted container"). But there's one key attribute of the enclave:
 * It is encrypted.That means that
 * if data is sent from the enclave, there is no way of knowing that the data came from the enclave.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     And even worse, there is no way of securely communicating with the enclave (since the enclave is
 *     fully isolated from the host, all information passed into the enclave has to go through its host
 *     first).
 * </p>
 * <p>To solve the communication problem, the Attest API can be used to facilitate what is
 * known as the "Secure Key Release" (SKR) protocol.</p>
 * <p>
 * There are 4 parties involved in an attestation operation:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The host (which hosts the enclave)</li>
 *     <li>The enclave (which is the enclave :)  encrypted, nobody can see what goes on inside it),</li>
 *     <li>The "verifier" which verifies the evidence from the enclave (this is the attestation service) and
 *     generates a token which can be received by a relying party, and </li>
 *     <li>The "relying party" which will interpret the token from the service. For the Secure Key Release Protocol,
 *     this is the entity which wishes to communicate with the enclave.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *   It's possible that all these parties are on the same computer, it's possible theyre on multiple computers.<br>
 *   It's possible that the host is also the relying party. It's possible that the relying party is a component
 *   like Azure Managed HSM.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are three primary pieces of data received by the service for the Attest family of APIs. All of them
 * are arrays of bytes, and all of them originate from code running in the enclave (thus they need to be
 * treated as opaque arrays of bytes by the SDK):
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Evidence. For Intel SGX enclaves, this has two forms, either an SGX 'Quote' or an
 * OpenEnclave 'Report'. It is required for attestation operations.</li>
 * <li>InitTimeData  This is data which is specified at Initialization Time. It is optional
 * (and not currently supported on all enclave types in Azure)</li>
 * <li>RunTimeData  this is data which is specified at the time the quote is generated (at runtime).
 * It is optional, but required for the Secure Key Release protocol.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The Evidence is cryptographically signed by a known authority (for Intel SGX Quotes or OpenEnclave reports, this
 * is a key owned by Intel which represents that the SGX enclave is valid and can be trusted).<br>
 * The core idea for all attestation operations is to take advantage of a region within the Evidence which
 * is controlled by enclave. For SGX Enclaves, this is the 64 bytes of "user data" contained within SGX quote.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     For the Secure Key Release protocol, code inside the enclave generates an asymmetric key and serializes the public
 *     key into a byte buffer. It then calculates the SHA256 hash of the serialized key and creates a quote
 *     containing that SHA256 hash. We now have a cryptographically validated indication that the contents
 *     of the byte buffer was known inside the enclave.
 *</p>
 * <p>
 * The enclave then hands the byte buffer and the quote to its host. The host sends the quote and byte
 * buffer as the "RunTime Data" to the via the {@link AttestationClient#attestSgxEnclave(byte[])}  or
 * {@link AttestationClient#attestOpenEnclave} API. Assuming the byte buffer and quote are valid,
 * and the quote contains the hash of the byte buffer, the attestation service responds with an {@link AttestationToken}
 * signed by the attestation service, whose body is an {@link AttestationResult}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The token generated also includes the contents of the InitTimeData and/or RunTimeData if it was
 *     provided in the Attest API call.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The host then sends the token to the relying party.  The relying party verifies the token
 * and verifies the claims within the token indicate that the enclave is the correct enclave.
 * It then takes the key from the token and uses it to encrypt the data to be sent to the
 * enclave and sends that back to the host, which passes it into the enclave.
 *
 *</p>
 * <p>
 *     That completes the secure key release protocol.
 * </p><br>
 * <p>When the Attestation Token is generated by the attestation service, as mentioned, it contains the
 * InitTime and RunTime data.</p>
 * <p>There are two possible representations for RunTime Data in the attestation token, depending on the requirements of the relying party:<br>
 * The first is as JSON formatted data. That can be convenient if the relying party expects to receive its
 * public key as a JSON Web Key <br>
 * The second is as a binary blob of data. That is needed if either the data sent by the enclave isn't
 * a JSON object - for instance, if the RunTime data contained an asymmetric key which is formatted as a
 * PEM encoded key, it should be interpreted as a binary blob</p>
 *
 * If you ask for the RunTime data to be included in the token as binary, then it will be base64url
 * encoded in the "x-ms-maa-enclavehelddata" claim in the output token (the
 * {@link AttestationResult#getEnclaveHeldData()} property).
 * <br>
 * If you ask for the RunTime data to be included in the token as JSON, then it will be included in the
 * "x-ms-maa-runtimeClaims" claim in the output token (the {@link AttestationResult#getRuntimeClaims()} property).
 *
 * <p>
 *     In addition to the Attest APIs, the {@link AttestationClient} object also contains helper APIs
 *     which can be used to retrieve the OpenId Metadata document and signing keys from the service.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The OpenId Metadata document contains properties which describe the attestation service.
 *     </p>
 * <p>
 *     The Attestation Signing Keys describe the keys which will be used to sign tokens generated by
 *     the attestation service. All tokens emitted by the attestation service will be signed by one
 *     of the certificates listed in the attestation signing keys.
 * </p>
