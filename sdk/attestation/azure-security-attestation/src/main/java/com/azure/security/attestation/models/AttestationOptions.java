/**
 * <p>
 * AttestationOptions represent the parameters sent to the
 * {@link com.azure.security.attestation.AttestationClient#attestOpenEnclave}
 * or {@link com.azure.security.attestation.AttestationClient#attestSgxEnclave}API.
 * </p><p>
 * Each {@link AttestationOptions} object expresses the options to attest an SGX enclave.
 * </p><p>
 * An enclave (or Trusted Execution Environment) is a chunk of code that is isolated
 * from its host. When code is running inside an enclave, there is a real challenge - if
 * the customer wants to communicate with code in the enclave, there is no way of
 * establishing a secure communication channel that can verify communication to the enclave.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * To support the "Secure Key Release" protocol which enables that communication, there are three
 * key pieces of information required:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Attestation Evidence (typically an SGX quote or OpenEnclave report</li>
 *     <li>InitTime Data - this is data specified when the TEE is created. (OPTIONAL)</li>
 *     <li>RunTime Data - this can be a public key or other information. (OPTIONAL)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * To perform an attestation operation, you need at minimum a set of attestation evidence.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the Secure Key Release scenario, the InitTime Data and RunTime Data are expressed in the token
 * returned by the Attestation Service, a relying party can use the  InitTime Data to make decisions
 * about whether the TEE can be trusted, and can use the RunTime Data as data which is known to have
 * come from inside the enclave (if, for instance the RunTime Data is an asymmetric cryptographic
 * key, it can be used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by code inside the TEE).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * For both InitTime and RunTime data, the data can be expressed in the token as either BINARY or
 * JSON data. This can simplify the evaluation process in the relying party.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * In addition to the evidence, InitTime and RunTime data, an Attest request can also take a "draft"
 * attestation policy. This can be used to determine how an attestation policy effects the claims
 * generated by the attestation service.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that when a client specifies a draft attestation policy the returned attestation token will not
 * be signed by the attestation service. That is to ensure that the token cannot be used by a relying
 * party.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The reason that both binary and JSON are represented as binary is that JSON encodings are ambiguous
 * – there are many possible semantically identical JSON encodings of the same data. Since we’re going
 * to take the SHA256 hash of the data, we accept a sequence of octets (byte[]) instead of a String
 * (depending on your encoding, the same string can be encoded as different sequences of octets).
 * </p>
