/**
 *
 * The AttestationAdministrationClient provides access to the administrative policy APIs
 * implemented by the Attestation Service.
 *
 * More information on attestation policies can be found <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/attestation/basic-concepts#attestation-policy'>here</a>
 *
 * There are two main families of APIs available from the Administration client.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Attestation Policy Management</li>
 *     <li>Attestation Policy Management Certificate Management</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Attestation service instances operate in three different modes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Shared - a shared instance is a regional instance which is available to all customers.
 *     It does NOT support customer specified policy documents - there is only a default policy available
 *     for each attestation type </li>
 *     <li>AAD - An attestation instance where the customer trusts Azure Active Directory (and Azure
 *     Role Based Access Control) to manage the security of their enclave. </li>
 *     <li>Isolated - an attestation instance where the customer does *not* trust Azure Active Directory
 *     (and RBAC) to manage the security of their enclave </li>
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * When an attestation instance is in Isolated mode, additional proof needs to be provided by the customer
 * to verify that they are authorized to perform the operation specified. This additional proof is
