If ye want to train a parrot, ye'll need to be patient and have a bit of luck on yer side. First, ye need to establish a good relationship with yer parrot by spending time with it and learning its body language. Then, ye can start training it using positive reinforcement techniques like reward-based training. This can include treats, praise and toys.\\nIt's important to keep the training sessions short, around 10-15 minutes a day and gradually increase the time over time. Finally, remember that every parrot is different, so ye may have to adjust yer training methods according to its personality and preferences. Hope that helps ye!\"}}],\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":134,\"prompt_tokens\":65,\"total_tokens\":199}}\n",
