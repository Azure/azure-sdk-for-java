  - Added `refusal` property in `ChatChoiceLogProbabilityInfo`, `ChatMessageContentItem`, `ChatResponseMessage` classes,
    and a new type of content item class `ChatMessageRefusalContentItem` to support refusal. `refusal` only works with structured output.
  - Added `json_schema` property in `ChatCompletionsResponseFormat` class to support JSON schema.
    New classes `ChatCompletionsJsonSchemaResponseFormat` and `ChatCompletionsJsonSchemaResponseFormatJsonSchema` are added to support JSON schema response format.

  `completeUpload` and `cancelUpload` introduced in `OpenAIClient` and `OpenAIAsyncClient` classes.
- Updated `ChatRequestMessages` derived classes, 
  - `ChatRequestSystemMessage` content: `String` or `ChatMessageTextContentItem[]`.
  - `ChatRequestAssistantMessage` content: `String`, `ChatMessageTextContentItem[]`, `ChatMessageRefusalContentItem[]` or `null`.
  - `ChatRequestToolMessage` content: `String` or `ChatMessageTextContentItem[]`.
- Added `rerank_score` property in `AzureChatExtensionDataSourceResponseCitation` class to support re-rank score.

  modify the HTTP request.
- Added the capability to handle the float[] `embedding` type when serializing to `toJson()` and deserializing from `fromJson()` in the `EmbeddingItem` class. ([#41159](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/41159))
- A new `required` keyword is added to `tool_choice` in the request options, which specifies that at least one tool must be called. This adds to the existing `auto` (default), `none`, and ability to specify a specific (function) tool by name
- New operation paths: `/batches`, `/batches/{batch-id}` and `/batches/{batch-id}/cancel`
- New request model: `BatchCreateRequest`

- In `ChatCompletionsOptions` the `setToolChoice` method uses `ChatCompletionsToolSelection` to pass either a preset enum or a named tool.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `finish_details` field from `ChatChoice` class since service API version, `2024-07-01-preview`, does not return this field. 

### Other Changes

#### Dependency Updates

  (word and/or segment) that controls which, if any, timestamp information is emitted to transcription results.
  - `AudioTranscriptionTimestampGranularity` enum to represent the timestamp granularity options for Whisper transcription.
  - `AudioTranscriptionWord` class to represent the word timestamp information in the transcription results.
- Added two new audio formats, `wav` and `pcm`, to the `SpeechGenerationResponseFormat` enum.

*AOAI ONLY*

- Added a new RAI content filter schema type, `ContentFilterDetailedResults`, that features:
    - The boolean `filtered` property from `ContentFilterResult`.
    - An array named `details` of the existing `ContentFilterBlocklistIdResult` type, each of which has:
      - The base boolean `filtered`
      - A string `id`
- Added a new property `indirectAttack` in `ContentFilterResultDetailsForPrompt` class to represent the indirect attack results.
- Added a new property `custom_blocklists` in `ImageGenerationPromptFilterResults` class to represent the prompt filter results.

**On Your Data**

- New string enum type used in options: `OnYourDataContextProperty`: "citations" | "intent" | "allRetrievedDocuments"

    - `AzureMachineLearningIndexChatExtensionParameters`
    - `AzureCosmosDBChatExtensionParameters`
    - `ElasticsearchChatExtensionParameters`
    - `PineconeChatExtensionParameters`
- Vectorization source types have a new `dimensions` property (optional int32)
    - Affected: `OnYourDataEndpointVectorizationSource`, `OnYourDataDeploymentNameVectorizationSource`
- `AzureSearchChatExtensionParameters` now supports `OnYourDataAccessTokenAuthenticationOptions` in its named `authentication` field
- `OnYourDataEndpointVectorizationSource` now supports `OnYourDataAccessTokenAuthenticationOptions` for its named `authentication` field.
- Added new class `OnYourDataVectorSearchAuthenticationType`, `OnYourDataVectorSearchAuthenticationOptions`,
  `OnYourDataVectorSearchApiKeyAuthenticationOptions`, `OnYourDataVectorSearchAccessTokenAuthenticationOptions` for the
  vector search authentication options.
- The response extension type `AzureChatExtensionsMessageContext` has a new `all_retrieved_documents` field, which is an optional array of the new `retrievedDocument` type defined earlier.

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced Jackson Databind annotations with `azure-json` functionality for OpenAI service models.
- [AOAI] Added a new class `ContentFilterDetailedResults` to represent detailed content filter results, which replaces the
  `customBlocklists` response property type, `List<ContentFilterBlocklistIdResult>` in 
  `ContentFilterResultDetailsForPrompt` and `ContentFilterResultsForChoice` class.
- [AOAI] Replaced `OnYourDataAuthenticationOptions` with `OnYourDataVectorSearchAuthenticationOptions` in the `OnYourDataEndpointVectorizationSource` class.
  Currently, `OnYourDataEndpointVectorizationSource` only supports `OnYourDataApiKeyAuthenticationOptions` and `OnYourDataAccessTokenAuthenticationOptions` as authentication options.

  or the [Azure OpenAI quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/text-to-speech-quickstart)
  for detailed overview and background information. The new method `generateSpeechFromText` exposes this capability on

  parallel function calling via tools, "JSON mode" for guaranteed function outputs, and more
- `dall-e-3` image generation capabilities via `getImageGenerations`, featuring higher model quality, automatic prompt
  revisions by `gpt-4`, and customizable quality/style settings
- Greatly expanded "On Your Data" capabilities in Azure OpenAI, including many new data source options and authentication
  mechanisms
- Early support for `gpt-4-vision-preview`, which allows the hybrid use of text and images as input to enable scenarios

Use `getAudioTranscription` or `getAudioTranscriptionWithResponse` convenience methods from respective classes.
- Removed methods `getAudioTranslationAsResponseObject` and `getAudioTranslationAsResponseObjectWithResponse` from `OpenAIClient` and `OpenAIAsyncClient` classes.
Use `getAudioTranslation` or `getAudioTranslationWithResponse` convenience methods from respective classes.

**`ChatMessage` changes:**

- The singular `ChatMessage` type has been replaced by `ChatRequestMessage` and `ChatResponseMessage`, the former of
  which is an abstract, polymorphic type with concrete derivations like `ChatRequestSystemMessage` and
  `ChatRequestUserMessage`. This requires conversion from old `ChatMessage` into the new types. While this is
  usually a straightforward string replacement, converting a response message into a request message (e.g. when
  propagating an assistant response to continue the conversation) will require creating a new instance of the
  appropriate request message with the response message's data. See the examples for details.

**Dall-e-3:**

- Azure OpenAI now uses `dall-e-3` model deployments for its image generation API and such a valid deployment must
  be provided into the options for the `getImageGenerations()` method to receive results.

### Other Changes

- Audio transcription and translation (via `getAudioTranscription()` and `getAudioTranslation()` now allow specification  
  of an optional `fileName` in addition to the binary audio data. This is used purely as an identifier and does not 
  functionally alter the transcription/translation behavior in any way.

## 1.0.0-beta.5 (2023-09-22)

### Features Added

- Added support for `Whisper` endpoints.
- Translation and Transcription of audio files is available.
- The above features are available both in Azure and non-Azure OpenAI.
- Added more convenience methods, which are wrappers around the existing`get{ChatCompletions|Completions|Embeddings}WithResponse` 
  methods with concrete data types instead of using `BinaryData` as the return data type. For example, a new method 
  introduced is
  - Async: `Mono<Response<ChatCompletions>> getChatCompletionsWithResponse(String deploymentOrModelName, ChatCompletionsOptions chatCompletionsOptions, RequestOptions requestOptions)`
  - Sync: `Response<ChatCompletions> getChatCompletionsWithResponse(String deploymentOrModelName, ChatCompletionsOptions chatCompletionsOptions, RequestOptions requestOptions)`
  
  Same methods are added for `Completions` and `Embeddings` endpoints as well.
