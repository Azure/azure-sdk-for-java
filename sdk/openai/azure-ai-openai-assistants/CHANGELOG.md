# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.2 (Unreleased)

### Features Added

### Breaking Changes

- The following class have been removed:
  - `FileListResponse`
  - `OpenAIPageableListOfAssistant`
  - `OpenAIPageableListOfAssistantFile`
  - `OpenAIPageableListOfMessageFile`
  - `OpenAIPageableListOfRunStep`
  - `OpenAIPageableListOfThreadMessage`
  - `OpenAIPageableListOfThreadRun` 

- We've introduced `PageableList<T>` these classes were used, except for `FileListResponse` where we simply return `List<OpenAIFile>`.

### Bugs Fixed

### Other Changes

- On `uploadFile` method in `AssistantsClient` and `AssistantsAsyncClient`, it is required to set the "filename" of the file, via `setFilename` method in `FileDetails` class. The double quote character `"`, the newline charactor `0x0A`, the return charactor `0x0D` in "filename" would be escaped by the client library.
