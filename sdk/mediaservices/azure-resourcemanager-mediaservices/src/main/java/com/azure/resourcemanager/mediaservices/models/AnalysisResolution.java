/**
 * Specifies the maximum resolution at which your video is analyzed. The default behavior is "SourceResolution," which
 * will keep the input video at its original resolution when analyzed. Using "StandardDefinition" will resize input
 * videos to standard definition while preserving the appropriate aspect ratio. It will only resize if the video is of
 * higher resolution. For example, a 1920x1080 input would be scaled to 640x360 before processing. Switching to
 * "StandardDefinition" will reduce the time it takes to process high resolution video. It may also reduce the cost of
 * using this component (see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics for details).
 * However, faces that end up being too small in the resized video may not be detected.
