- Update `azure-core-http-netty` dependency to `1.9.2`.

## 4.2.0 (2021-04-07)

### Dependency Updates
- Update `azure-core` dependency to `1.15.0`.
- Update `azure-core-http-netty` dependency to `1.9.1`.

## 4.1.0 (2021-03-25)
### New Features
- Added new system event model class `AcsRecordingFileStatusUpdatedEventData`.
- Added new attribute `transactionId` to `AcsChatEventInThreadBaseProperties`.
- Added new attribute `tag` to `AcsSmsDeliveryReportReceivedEventData`.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed event types in `SystemEventNames` for system event data `AcsChatParticipantRemovedFromThreadEventData` and `AcsChatParticipantAddedToThreadEventData`.
- Added `COMMUNICATION_CHAT_PARTICIPANT_REMOVED_FROM_THREAD` to `SystemEventNames` and deprecated `COMMUNICATION_CHAT_MESSAGE_REMOVED_FROM_THREAD`.
- Added `COMMUNICATION_CHAT_PARTICIPANT_REMOVED_FROM_THREAD_WITH_USER` to `SystemEventNames` and deprecated `COMMUNICATION_CHAT_MESSAGE_REMOVED_FROM_THREAD_WITH_USER`.

## 4.0.0 (2021-03-11)
### New Features
- added `sendEvent` to `EventGridPublisherClient` and `EventGridPublisherAsyncClient` to send a single event.

### Breaking changes
- `CloudEvent` is moved to `azure-core` SDK version 1.14.0. Its constructor uses `BinaryData` instead of `Object` as the data type for `data`.
- `EventGridEvent` constructor also uses `BinaryData` instead of `Object` as the data type for `data`.
- To send custom events, `sendEvents` accepts `Iterable<BinaryData>` instead of `Iterable<Object>`.
- `EventGridPublisherClientBuilder.serializer()` is removed because `BinaryData.fromObject(Object data, ObjectSerializer serializer)` already supports custom serializer, which can be used to
  serialize custom events and the data of `CloudEvent` and `EventGridEvent`.
- `EventGridPublisherClient` is changed to `EventGridPublisherClient<T>` that can be statically instantiated to send `CloudEvent`, `EventGridEvent` or custom events (use `BinaryData`)
  with methods `sendEvents` and `sendEvent`. 
  `EventGridPublisherClientBuilder` now has `buildCloudEventPublisherClient`, `buildEventGridEventPublisherClient` and `buildCustomEventPublisherClient` to build the generic-instantiated clients respectively.
  The async client has the same change.
- `EventGridPublisherClientBuilder.endpoint()` now requires the EventGrid topic or domain full url endpoint because
  different EventGrid service deployments may require different url patterns.
- `EventGridSasGenerator` is removed. Method `generateSas` is moved to `EventGridPublisherClient` and `EventGridPublisherAsyncClient`. 

### Dependency Updates
- Update `azure-core` dependency to `1.14.0`.
- Update `azure-core-http-netty` dependency to `1.9.0`.

## 2.0.0-beta.4 (2021-02-10)
### Breaking changes
- `CloudEvent` constructor now accepts parameter "data". Removed `setData()`.
- `CloudEvent.parse()` and `EventGridEvent.parse()` are renamed to `fromString()`.
- `CloudEvent::getData()` of CloudEvent and EventGridEvent now returns `com.azure.core.util.BinaryData`. 
  Users can use methods `BinaryData` to deserialize event data. The generic version of `getData()` is then removed.
- Removed `CloudEvent::getDataAsync()`
- Added `EventGridSasGenerator` class and removed `EventGridSasCredential`. Use `EventGridSasGenerator.generateSas()` to
  create a Shared Access Signature and use `AzureSasCredential` to build a `EventGridPublisherClient`.
- Renamed `sendEvents` to `sendEventGridEvents`

### Dependency Updates
- Update `azure-core` dependency to `1.13.0`.
- Update `azure-core-http-netty` dependency to `1.8.0`.
- Remove dependency on `azure-core-serializer-json-jackson`.

## 2.0.0-beta.3 (2020-10-06)
### New Features
- Added support for distributed tracing.

## 2.0.0-beta.2 (2020-09-24)
Added system event classes for Azure Communication Services under package `com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.systemevents`.

## 2.0.0-beta.1 (2020-09-09)

Initial preview of the Event Grid library with an effort to create a Java idiomatic
set of libraries that are consistent across multiple services as well as different languages.

### Features:

+ Configurable synchronous and asynchronous publishing clients, supporting sending of user-defined events in 
    Event Grid, Cloud Event, or a custom schema.
+ Parsing and deserialization of system and user-defined events from JSON payload
    at an event destination in EventGrid or Cloud Event schema.
