### Breaking Changes

#### Serialization/Deserialization change

- `Jackson` is removed from dependency and no longer supported.

##### Migration Guide

If you are using `Jackson`/`ObjectMapper` for manual serialization/deserialization, configure your `ObjectMapper` for backward compatibility:
```java
objectMapper.registerModule(com.azure.core.serializer.json.jackson.JacksonJsonProvider.getJsonSerializableDatabindModule());
```
