/**
 * A Job Preparation Task to run before any Tasks of the Job on any given
 * Compute Node.
 * You can use Job Preparation to prepare a Node to run Tasks for the Job.
 * Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading common
 * resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation Task
 * can download these common resource files to the shared location on the Node.
 * (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service on the Node so
 * that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation
 * Task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code
 * 0), Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The Compute Node
 * remains ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The
 * Compute Node remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job
 * Preparation Task can run multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you
 * should write the Job Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is
 * rebooted, the Job Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before
 * scheduling any other Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is
 * true or if the Job Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node
 * is reimaged, the Job Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any
 * Task of the Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is
 * triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not
 * limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared
 * due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of
 * and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
 * maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may
 * occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks
 * need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any
 * corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to
 * use some form of checkpointing.
