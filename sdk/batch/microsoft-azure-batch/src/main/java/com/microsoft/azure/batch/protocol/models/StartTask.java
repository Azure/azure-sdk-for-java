/**
 * A Task which is run when a Node joins a Pool in the Azure Batch service, or
 * when the Compute Node is rebooted or reimaged.
 * Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
 * Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
 * unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host
 * failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not
 * counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,
 * an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,
 * all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing. In some cases the start Task may be re-run even though the
 * Compute Node was not rebooted. Special care should be taken to avoid start
 * Tasks which create breakaway process or install/launch services from the
 * start Task working directory, as this will block Batch from being able to
 * re-run the start Task.
