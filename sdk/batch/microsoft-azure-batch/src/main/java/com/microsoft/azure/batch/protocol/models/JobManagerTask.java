/**
 * Specifies details of a Job Manager Task.
 * The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The
 * Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks
 * in the Job. When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve Nodes
 * where Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is,
 * Compute Nodes running 'normal' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes
 * running Job Manager Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be
 * restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there
 * are no idle Compute Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the
 * running Tasks in the Pool and return it to the queue in order to make room
 * for the Job Manager Task to restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job
 * does not have priority over Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level
 * priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job
 * needs to be restarted, it will not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch
 * will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples
 * of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
 * Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries
 * due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against
 * the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry
 * due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
 * idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
 * restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best
 * practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
