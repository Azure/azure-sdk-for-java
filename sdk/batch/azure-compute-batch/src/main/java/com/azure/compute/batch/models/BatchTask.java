/**
 * Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
 * Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
 * unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure.
 * Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
 * against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal
 * retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should
 * be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
 * restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice
 * for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
