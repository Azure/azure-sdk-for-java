/**
 * Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but
 * are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due
 * to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
 * maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
 * idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or
 * duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing. In some cases the
 * StartTask may be re-run even though the Compute Node was not rebooted. Special care should be taken to avoid
 * StartTasks which create breakaway process or install/launch services from the StartTask working directory, as this
 * will block Batch from being able to re-run the StartTask.
