/**
 * A Job Preparation Task to run before any Tasks of the Job on any given Compute Node.
 * You can use Job Preparation to prepare a Node to run Tasks for the Job.
 * Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading common
 * resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation Task can
 * download these common resource files to the shared location on the Node.
 * (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service on the Node so
 * that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation Task
 * fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0),
 * Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The Compute Node remains
 * ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The Compute Node
 * remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job Preparation Task can run
 * multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you should write the Job
 * Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job
 * Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other
 * Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job
 * Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job
 * Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will
 * retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is
 * rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to
 * recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the
 * maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to
 * a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
 * idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted
 * without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long
 * running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
