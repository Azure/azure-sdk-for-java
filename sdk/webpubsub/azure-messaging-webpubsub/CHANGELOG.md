Version 1.0.0-beta.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library for Azure Web PubSub that is 
developer-friendly, idiomatic to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as 
possible. The principles that guide our efforts can be found in the 
[Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).
