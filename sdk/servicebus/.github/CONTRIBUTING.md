## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Filing Issues

You can find all of the issues that have been filed in the [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java/issues) section of the repository.

If your first sample is not running as expected or you notice some WARNING or ERROR traces in the console, it is likely to do with your configuration, not a bug. Focus on the exception thrown to your code, not on the traces alone. Go through our samples, read the API documentation before filing an issue.

If you encounter any bugs, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java/issues/new) and make sure to fill out the provided template with the requested information.

To suggest a new feature or changes that could be made, file an issue the same way you would for a bug, but remove the provided template and replace it with information about your suggestion.

### Pull Requests
