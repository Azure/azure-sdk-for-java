/**
 * A <b>synchronous</b> receiver responsible for receiving {@link ServiceBusReceivedMessage} from a queue or
 * topic/subscription on Azure Service Bus.
 *
 * <p>The examples shown in this document use a credential object named DefaultAzureCredential for authentication,
 * which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production environments. Additionally, we
 * recommend using
 * <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/">managed identity</a>
 * for authentication in production environments. You can find more information on different ways of authenticating and
 * their corresponding credential types in the
 * <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme">Azure Identity documentation"</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Sample: Create a receiver and receive messages</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>The following code sample demonstrates the creation and use of the synchronous client
 * {@link com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverClient} to receive messages from a Service Bus subscription.
 * The receive operation returns when either 10 messages are received or 30 seconds has elapsed.  By default, messages
 * are received using {@link com.azure.messaging.servicebus.models.ServiceBusReceiveMode#PEEK_LOCK} and customers must
 * settle their messages using one of the settlement methods on the receiver client.
 * "<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#peeklock">
 *     "Settling receive operations</a>" provides additional information about message settlement.</p>

 * &#125;&#41;;
 *
 * &#47;&#47; When program ends, or you're done receiving all messages, dispose of the receiver.
