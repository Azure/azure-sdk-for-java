## 7.0.0 (2020-11-30)

### New Features
- Exposing enum 'ServiceBusFailureReason' in 'ServiceBusException' which contains a set of well-known reasons for an
  Service Bus operation failure.
- Added 'BinaryData' support to  'ServiceBusReceivedMessage' and 'ServiceBusMessage'. It provides an easy abstraction 
  over many different ways that binary data can be represented. It also provides support for serialize and deserialize
  Object.
- Introducing 'ServiceBusProcessorClient': It provides a push-based mechanism that invokes the message processing 
  callback when a message is received or the error handler when an error occurs when receiving messages. It supports 
  auto-settlement of messages by default.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed all the 'peekMessageAt()' API to 'peekMessage()' in 'ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient' and 
  'ServiceBusReceiverClient'.
- Rename 'getAmqpAnnotatedMessage()' to 'getRawAmqpMessage()' in 'ServiceBusReceivedMessage' and 'ServiceBusMessage'.

### Bug Fixes
- Set the default 'prefetch' to 0 instead of 1 in both 'RECEIVE_AND_DELETE' and 'PEEK_LOCK' mode. User can set this 
  value in builder.

### Known issues
- Can not resolve `BinaryData` or `NoClassDefFoundError` 
  NoClassDefFoundError When using `azure-messaging-servicebus:7.0.0` and other Azure SDKs in the same pom.xml file.
  Check [here][known-issue-binarydata-notfound] for more details.

### Other Changes
#### Dependency Updates   
- Upgraded `azure-core` dependency to `1.11.0`.
- Upgraded `azure-core-amqp` dependency to `2.0.0`.
  
## 7.0.0-beta.7 (2020-11-06)
### New Features
- Added automatic message and session lock renewal feature on the receiver clients. By default, this will be done 
  for 5 minutes.
- Added auto complete feature to the async receiver clients. Once the client completes executing the user provided 
  callback for a message, the message will be completed. If the user provided callback throws an error, the message 
  will be abandoned. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled by calling `disableAutoComplete()` on 
  builder. 
- An intermediate `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClient` is introduced to act as the factory which can then be used to accept 
  sessions from the service. Accepting a session would give you the familiar receiver client tied to a single session.
- Added `ServiceBusProcessorClient` which takes your callbacks to process messages and errors in an infinite loop. This 
  also supports working with sessions where you can provide the maximum number of sessions to work with concurrently. 
  When the client no longer receives any messages from one session, it rolls over to the next available session.
- Added `BinaryData` in `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` and `ServiceBusMessage`. `BinaryData` is convenience wrapper over
  byte array and provides object serialization functionality.
- Added `ServicebusReceiverException` and `ServiceBusErrorSource` to provide better handling of errors while receiving 
  messages.

### Breaking Changes
- Changed `receiveMessages` API to return `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` instead of ServiceBusReceivedMessageContext in 
  `ServiceBusReceiverAsynClient` and `ServiceBusReceiverClient`.
- Removed `SendVia` option from `ServiceBusClientBuilder`. See issue for more detail 
  [16942](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/16942).
- Removed `sessionId` setting from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClientBuilder` as creating receiver clients bound to a 
  single session is now a feature in the new intermediate clients `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClient` and 
  `ServiceBusSessionReceiverAsyncClient`.
- Moved the `maxConcurrentSessions` setting from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClientBuilder` to 
  `ServiceBusSessionProcessorClientBuilder` as the feature of receiving messages from multiple sessions is moved from 
  the receiver client to the new `ServiceBusSessionProcessorClient`.
- Renamed `tryAdd` to `tryAddMessage` in `ServiceBusMessageBatch`.
- Removed `sessionId` specific methods from `ServiceBusReceiverAsynClient` and `ServiceBusReceiverClient` because now 
  receiver client is always tied to one session. 
  
### Bug Fixes
- `ServiceBusAdministrationClient`: Fixes serialization bug for creating and deserializing rules.

### Other Changes
#### Dependency Updates
- Added new `azure-core-experimental` dependency with version `1.0.0-beta.8`.

  `ServiceBusMessage`.

  `renewSessionLock` of classes `ServiceBusReceiverClient` and `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient` to lock messages and
  sessions.
- Update datetime related APIs to use `java.time.OffsetDateTime` instead of `java.time.Instant`.
- Remove `scheduledMessageCount` from `SubscriptionRuntimeInfo` and added it to `TopicRuntimeInfo`.
- Change `QueueRuntimeInfo`, `TopicRuntimeInfo` and `SubscriptionRuntimeInfo` to `QueueRuntimeProperties`,
  `TopicRuntimeProperties` and `SubscriptionRuntimeProperties` respectively.
- Add ability to authenticate using SAS.
- Add support for `AuthorizationRules` during management operations.
- Rename `ServiceBusManagementClient` to `ServiceBusAdministrationClient`.
- Remove `ServiceBusDeadletterReceiverBuilder` and replaced with `SubQueue` type to access transfer deadletter and 
  deadletter queue.

## 7.0.0-beta.5 (2020-08-11)
- Remove public constructor for QueueDescription, TopicDescription, SubscriptionDescription.
- Expose CreateQueueOptions, CreateTopicOptions, CreateSubscriptionOptions to create entities.

- Add support to send a collection of messages at once without needing to create a `ServiceBusMessageBatch` first. This
  will throw an error/exception will the messages cannot fit as per batch size restrictions
- Change return type from `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` to `ServiceBusReceivedMessageContext` when calling `receive()` so
  users can distinguish between transient failure scenarios where receiving continues and an actual terminal signal that
  is signaled through the downstream `onError`.
- Fix message settlement to occur on receive link
- Fix issue where backpressure is not properly supported

## 7.0.0-beta.1 (2020-04-06)

Version 7.0.0-beta.1 is a beta of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic
to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide
our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for
.Java](https://azuresdkspecs.z5.web.core.windows.net/JavaSpec.html).

### Features

- Reactive streams support using [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/).
