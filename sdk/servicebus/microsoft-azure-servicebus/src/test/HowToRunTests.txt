How to run unit tests?
-----------------------
Tests are simple JUnit tests. They can be run from the command line or any IDE that supports running JUnit tests.
Only prerequisite to running tests is setting an environment variable named 'AZURE_SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING' to the connection string
 of the namespace in which the tests will create entities. The tests create entities in the namespace and run tests and delete the created entities.
And test classes also have methods to specify whether to create entities per test or once for all tests in a suite. Creating entities per test is better
as it keeps test independent of each other.

To use a proxy for unit tests, set an environment variable `RUN_WITH_PROXY` to `true`. Then set the environment variables `PROXY_HOSTNAME` and `PROXY_PORT` to your values.
