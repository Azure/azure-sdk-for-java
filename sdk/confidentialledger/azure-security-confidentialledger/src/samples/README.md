# Azure Confidential Ledger client library samples for Java

Azure Confidential Ledger samples are a set of self-contained Java programs that demonstrate interacting with Azure self-contained service using the client library. Each sample focuses on a specific scenario and can be executed independently.

## Key concepts

Key concepts are explained in detail [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/confidentialledger/azure-security-confidentialledger/README.md#key-concepts).

## Getting started

Getting started explained in detail [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/confidentialledger/azure-security-confidentialledger/README.md#getting-started).

## Examples

```java readme-sample-createClient
ConfidentialLedgerClient confidentialLedgerClient =
        new ConfidentialLedgerClientBuilder()
                .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
                .ledgerUri("https://my-ledger.confidential-ledger.azure.com")
                .buildClient();
```

The following sections provide code samples covering common scenario operations with the Azure Confidential Ledger client library.

All of these samples need the endpoint to your Confidential Ledger resource, and your Confidential Ledger API key.
