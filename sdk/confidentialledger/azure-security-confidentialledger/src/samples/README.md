# Azure Confidential Ledger client library samples for Java

Azure Confidential Ledger samples are a set of self-contained Java programs that demonstrate interacting with Azure self-contained service using the client library. Each sample focuses on a specific scenario and can be executed independently.

## Key concepts

## Getting started

Getting started explained in detail [here][SDK_README_GETTING_STARTED].

## Examples
