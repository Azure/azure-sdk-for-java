     * Feature that determines what to do if the underlying data format requires knowledge
     * of all properties to decode (usually via a Schema), and if no definition is
     * found for a property that input content contains.
     * Typically most textual data formats do NOT require schema information (although
     * some do, such as CSV), whereas many binary data formats do require definitions
     * (such as Avro, protobuf), although not all (Smile, CBOR, BSON and MessagePack do not).
     * Further note that some formats that do require schema information will not be able
     * to ignore undefined properties: for example, Avro is fully positional and there is
     * no possibility of undefined data. This leaves formats like Protobuf that have identifiers
     * that may or may not map; and as such Protobuf format does make use of this feature.
     *<p>
     * Note that support for this feature is implemented by individual data format
     * module, if (and only if) it makes sense for the format in question. For JSON,
     * for example, this feature has no effect as properties need not be pre-defined.

     * exception with that location information). If feature is disabled, no source reference

     * Most common reason for disabling this feature is to avoid leaking

     * printed, and not the whole contents. Further, many source reference types can not
     * necessarily access contents (like streams), so only type is indicated, not contents.
