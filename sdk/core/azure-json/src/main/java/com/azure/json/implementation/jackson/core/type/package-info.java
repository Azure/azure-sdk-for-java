 * Contains classes needed for type introspection, mostly used by data binding

 * to determine how contained types (of {@link java.util.Collection} and
 * {@link java.util.Map} classes) are to be handled.
 *<p>
 * With 2.9, an additional type ({@link com.azure.json.implementation.jackson.core.type.WritableTypeId})
 * was added to help handling of type identifiers needed to support polymorphic
 * type serialization, deserialization.
