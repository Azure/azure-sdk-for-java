### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where SendTimeout-timer thread was not being disposed of resulting in lingering
  threads when a send link was remotely closed.
- Fixed a bug where ReactorConnection waited indefinitely for CBS node to complete closing. The underlying problem is
  that the RequestResponseChannel's sender and receiver links were not active, so they would wait forever for a remote
  close signal.
- Fixed a bug where ReactorReceiver and ReactorSender would not complete their close operation if their close work could
  not be scheduled on the proton-j Reactor. This happens in the case that the connection is shutdown before the link.
- Fixed a bug where RejectedExecutionExceptions and IllegalStateExceptions would not be retried. This happens in the
  case that an IO pipe is interrupted while signalling the Reactor work queue.

## 2.3.0 (2021-07-01)

### Features Added

## 2.0.2 (2021-02-05)

### New Features

- Updates RetryUtil to use RetrySpec.
- Adds the ability to configure the `hostname` and `port` that will be used when connecting to a service via
  `ConnectionOptions`. The `hostname` field refers to the DNS host or IP address of the service, whereas the
  `fullyQualifiedNamespace` is the fully qualified host name of the service.
  Normally `hostname` and `fullyQualifiedNamespace` will be the same. However, if your network does not allow
  connecting to the service via the public host, you can specify a custom host (e.g. an application gateway) via the
  `hostname` field and continue using the public host as the `fullyQualifiedNamespace`.

## 2.0.1 (2021-01-11)

  properties.
- Added static methods to instantiate 'AmqpMessageBody' for example 'AmqpMessageBody#fromData(byte[])'.

### Breaking Changes
- Changed  'AmqpMessageBody' from an interface to a class. User can use 'getBodyType()' to know what is the
  'AmqpBodyType' of the message.
- Changed type of 'correlationId' and 'messageId' in type 'AmqpMessageProperties' from 'String' to 'AmqpMessageId'.
- Changed type of 'replyTo' and 'to' in type 'AmqpMessageProperties' from 'String' to 'AmqpAddress'.
