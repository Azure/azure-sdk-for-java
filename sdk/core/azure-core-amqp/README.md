# Azure Core AMQP client library for Java

Azure Core AMQP client library is a collection of classes common to the AMQP protocol. It help developers create their
own AMQP client library that abstracts from the underlying transport library's implementation.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

</dependency>

## Key concepts

1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-overview-v1.0-os.html).
