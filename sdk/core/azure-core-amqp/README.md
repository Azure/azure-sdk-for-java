# Azure Core AMQP shared library for Java

Azure Core AMQP client library is a collection of classes common to the AMQP protocol. It help developers create their
own AMQP client library that abstracts from the underlying transport library's implementation.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link], version 8 or later.

### Include the package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-core-amqp;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-core-amqp</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## Key concepts

The concepts for AMQP are well documented in [OASIS Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMQP) Version
1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-overview-v1.0-os.html).

## Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Enabling Logging

Azure SDKs for Java offer a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite
their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help
locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.
