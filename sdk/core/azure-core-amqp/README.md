# Azure Core AMQP client library for Java

Azure Core AMQP client library is a collection of classes common to the AMQP protocol. It help developers create their
own AMQP client library that abstracts from the underlying transport library's implementation.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above

### Adding the package to your product

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-core-amqp</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-preview.6</version>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts

1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-overview-v1.0-os.html).
