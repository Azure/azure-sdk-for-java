/**
 * The modified outcome.
 * <p>
 * At the source the modified outcome means that the message is no longer acquired by the receiver, and has been made
 * available for (re-)delivery to the same or other targets receiving from the node. The message has been changed at the
 * node in the ways indicated by the fields of the outcome. As modified is a terminal outcome, transfer of payload data
 * will not be able to be resumed if the link becomes suspended. A delivery can become modified at the source even
 * before all transfer frames have been sent. This does not imply that the remaining transfers for the delivery will not
 * be sent. The source MAY spontaneously attain the modified outcome for a message (for example the source might
 * implement some sort of time-bound acquisition lock, after which the acquisition of a message at a node is revoked to
 * allow for delivery to an alternative consumer with the message modified in some way to denote the previous failed,
 * e.g., with delivery-failed set to true).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At the target, the modified outcome is used to indicate that a given transfer was not and will not be acted upon, and
 * that the message SHOULD be modified in the specified ways at the node.
 * </p>
