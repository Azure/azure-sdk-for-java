/**
 * <p>Represents an immutable access token with a token string and an expiration time.</p>
 *
 * <p>An Access Token is a security token that is issued by an authentication source, such as
 * Azure Active Directory (AAD), and it represents the authorization to access a specific resource or service.
 * It is typically used to authenticate and authorize requests made to Azure services.</p>
 *
 * <p>Access Tokens are obtained through the authentication process, where the user or application presents valid
 * credentials (such as a client ID, client secret, username/password, or certificate) to the authentication source.
 * The authentication source then verifies the credentials and issues an Access Token, which is a time-limited token
 * that grants access to the requested resource.</p>
 *
 * <p>Once an Access Token is obtained, it can be included in the Authorization header of HTTP requests to
 * authenticate and authorize requests to Azure services.</p>
