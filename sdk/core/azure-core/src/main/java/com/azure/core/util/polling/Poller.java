/**
 * This class offers API that simplifies the task of executing long-running operations against an Azure service. The
 * {@link Poller} consists of a poll operation, a cancel operation, if it is supported by the Azure service, and a
 * polling interval.
 *
 * <p>
 * It provides the following functionality:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Querying the current state of long-running operations.</li>
 *      <li>Requesting an asynchronous notification for long-running operation's state.</li>
 *      <li>Cancelling the long-running operation if cancellation is supported by the service.</li>
 *      <li>Triggering a poll operation manually.</li>
 *      <li>Enable/Disable auto-polling.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Auto polling</strong></p>
 * Auto-polling is enabled by default. The {@link Poller} starts polling as soon as the instance is created. The
 * {@link Poller} will transparently call the poll operation every polling cycle and track the state of the
 * long-running operation. Azure services can return {@link PollResponse#getRetryAfter()} to override the
 * {@code Poller.pollInterval} defined in the {@link Poller}. {@link #getStatus()} represents the status returned by a
 * successful long-running operation at the time the last auto-polling or last manual polling, whichever happened most
 * recently.
 *
 * <p><strong>Disable auto polling</strong></p>
 * For those scenarios which require manual control of the polling cycle, disable auto-polling by calling
 * {@link #setAutoPollingEnabled(boolean) setAutoPollingEnabled(false)}. Then perform manual polling by invoking
 * {@link #poll()} function. It will call poll operation once and update {@link #getStatus()} with the latest status.
 *
 * <p>When auto-polling is disabled, the {@link Poller} will not update its status or any other information, unless
 * manual polling is triggered by calling {@link #poll()} function.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Poller} will stop polling when the long-running operation is complete or disabled. Polling is
 * considered complete based on status defined in {@link OperationStatus}.
