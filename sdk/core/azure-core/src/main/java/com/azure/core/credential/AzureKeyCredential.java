/**
 * <p>The {@link AzureKeyCredential} is used to authenticate and authorize requests made to Azure services.
 * It is specifically designed for scenarios where you need to authenticate using a key.</p>
 *
 * <p>A key is a unique identifier or token that is associated with a specific user or application. It serves as a
 * simple form of authentication to ensure that only authorized clients can access the protected resources or APIs.
 * This authentication is commonly used for accessing certain services, such as Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Search,
 * or Azure Management APIs. Each service may have its own specific way of using API keys, but the general concept
 * remains the same. The {@link com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential} allows you to authenticate
 * using a key.</p>
