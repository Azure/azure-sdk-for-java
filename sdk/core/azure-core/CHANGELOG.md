# Release History

## 1.42.0-beta.1 (2023-07-24)

### Features Added
- Added `setEnableCae` and `isCaeEnabled` APIs to `TokenRequestContext` to indicate CAE authentication flow to be used downstream.

## 1.41.0 (2023-07-06)

### Features Added

- Added a `KeyCredential` to support key-based auth.
- `AzureKeyCredential` now to extends from `KeyCredential`.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `PagedIterable.mapPage` would result in a `NullPointerException`. ([#35123](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35123))

## 1.40.0 (2023-06-02)

### Features Added

- Added `TracingOptions` configurations allowing to pick a specific `TracerProvider` implementation if several are resolved by `ServiceLoader`. 
- Added `MetricsOptions` configurations allowing to pick a specific `MeterProvider` implementation if several are resolved by `ServiceLoader`.
- Added `CoreUtils.randomUuid` to replace usage of `UUID.randomUUID`. In some cases `UUID.randomUUID` used a blocking 
  call whereas `CoreUtils.randomUuid` should never block. ([#34790](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/34790))
- Added support for prefixes in `AzureKeyCredentialPolicy`. ([#35010](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35010))
- Added the ability to configure a backoff strategy for `FluxUtil.createRetriableDownloadFlux`. Previous retries 
  wouldn't backoff which could result in requests being sent to a service already at capacity and throttling. ([#35035](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35035))

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug where a known length wasn't passed to `BinaryData.fromStream` resulting it being handled as a 
  non-replayable `BinaryData`. ([#34851](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/34851))
- Changed the design of how `AsynchronousByteChannel`s were written to limit chances of race conditions between the
  writer thread and the Reactor thread handling `onComplete` and `onError` events. This results in more consistent 
  behavior at the cost of lower throughput, which will be investigated in future releases. ([#35004](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35004))

### Other Changes

- Changed how `ResponseError` is deserialized to support cases where the JSON wrapped the `ResponseError` with an 
  `error` property. ([#35052](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35052))

### Dependency Updates

- Upgraded Reactor Core from `3.4.27` to `3.4.29`.

## 1.39.0 (2023-05-04)

### Features Added

- Added `HttpHeaders.setAllHttpHeaders(HttpHeaders)` to provide a way to efficiently combine two `HttpHeaders`.
- Added `CoreUtils.parseQueryParameters` to efficient parse query parameters without array overhead found with `String.split`.

### Breaking Changes

- Deprecated `String`-based APIs on `HttpHeaders`, `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`, and `RequestOptions`. Use 
  `HttpHeaderName`-based APIs instead as they provide better performance.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed an edge case when parsing query parameters without a value (`key&key2=value2`). ([#34459](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/34459))

### Other Changes

- Changed how handling supporting multiple versions of Jackson happens internally to reduce usage of reflection. ([#34468](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/34468))
- Improved request and response body logging to reduce memory allocations.

## 1.38.0 (2023-04-07)

### Features Added

- Added new constructor overload to `DefaultPollingStrategy`, `OperationResourcePollingStrategy`, `LocationPollingStrategy`
  and their sync counterparts that allows setting a service version as query parameter of request URLs for polling and 
  getting the final result of a long-running operation.

### Other Changes

- Added dependency on `azure-json` to provide stream-style JSON serialization support for `JsonSerializable`
  implementing classes.

## 1.37.0 (2023-03-02)

### Features Added

- Added `CoreUtils.bytesToHexString` as a common utility for creating hex strings.
- Added `CoreUtils.extractSizeFromContentRange` as a common utility for extracting the entity size from a properly
  formatted `Content-Range` header.
- Added support for `JsonSerializable` and `XmlSerializable` in `JacksonAdapter` serialize and deserialize APIs. ([#33685](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/33685))

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `jackson-dataformat-xml` as a dependency. XML serialization is still supported when `jackson-dataformat-xml`
  is found on the classpath, if it's not a class not found exception/error will be thrown when attempting to use XML
  serialization. ([#33401](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/33401))

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug where a method not found error would be thrown when attempting to reflectively access Jackson Databind 2.12+
  APIs. ([#33448](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/33448))
- Fixed a bug where HTTP headers and query parameters weren't included in HTTP request and response logging when
  `INFORMATIONAL` log level was used.

### Dependency Updates

- Upgraded Reactor Core from `3.4.26` to `3.4.27`.
- Upgraded Jackson to the latest releases `2.13.5`.

## 1.36.0 (2023-02-01)

### Features Added

- Added explicit support for `text`-based serialization, this is done by adding `SerializerEncoding.TEXT`. Previously,
  `text` was being implicitly supported by using `SerializerEncoding.JSON` but there were edge cases when a `String`
  wasn't a JSON string (`string` vs `"string"`). ([#32277](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32277))
- Added `BinaryData.fromListByteBuffer(List<ByteBuffer>)` to support additional ways to create `BinaryData`. ([#32932](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32932))
- Added `TracingOptions` to make tracing configurable. ([#32573](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32573))
- Added support for links, start timestamp, W3C trace-context propagation, and numerical attributes in tracing.
- Tracing plugins are no longer required to implement `AfterRetryPolicyProvider` as tracing is now handled by
  `InstrumentationPolicy` using the provided `Tracer` implementation.

### Breaking Changes

- Deprecated messaging-specific methods in tracing abstractions.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `PollingStrategy.getResult` would guard getting results for `POST`-based on containing a `Location`
  header which isn't guaranteed to exist. If the header doesn't exist the body of the last polling operation is used
  as the final result. ([#32815](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32815))
- Fixed a bug where `HEAD`-based requests were checking for a body before deserializing. `HEAD` requests shouldn't have
  a body or if they do it should be ignored. ([#32833](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32833))

### Other Changes

- Exceptions when deserializing error HTTP responses now include the deserialization exception as the causal exception
  in addition to logging it.
- `ExpandableStringEnum` now uses `MethodHandle` instead of `Constructor` to create subtype instances when using
  `fromString(String, Class<T>)`.

## 1.35.0 (2023-01-05)

### Features Added

- Added corresponding `HttpHeaderName` APIs to `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`.
- Enhanced exception based retrying by inspecting the causal exceptions in addition to the thrown exception.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug where cancellation would result in an application stall by using `doFinally` instead of `doOnTermination` ([#32727](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32727)).

### Other Changes

- Added more details to key exception messages.

### Dependency Updates

- Upgraded Reactor Core from `3.4.23` to `3.4.26`.

## 1.34.0 (2022-11-04)

### Features Added

- Added `HttpHeaderName`, and corresponding methods on `HttpHeaders`, which provides a way of adding, accessing, and 
  removing `HttpHeader`s from `HttpHeaders` without needing to call `String.toLowercase`. ([#30924](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/30924))
- Added `SyncPollingStrategy`, and implementations of it, to compliment the asynchronous `PollingStrategy`. ([#31923](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/31923))
- Added a new factory method on `SyncPoller` matching the factory method on `PollerFlux`, except taking `SyncPollingStrategy`
  instead of `PollingStrategy`.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `void` and `Void` responses would attempt to create a `byte[]` the size of the response 
  `Content-Length`. ([#31865](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/31865))
- Fixed a bug where `SyncPoller` `waitUntil` or `waitForCompletion` didn't update the terminal poll context correctly. ([#31905](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/31905))

### Other Changes

- Removed size limit when creating a `BinaryData.fromFlux` when the `Flux<ByteBuffer>` is buffered.
- Deprecated empty argument constructor in `ExpandableStringEnum` subtypes.
- Miscellaneous performance improvements.

  `HttpClient.createDefault(HttpClientOptions)`. ([#30894](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/30894))
- Added `BinaryData.fromByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)`.
- Added `SyncPoller.createPoller(Duration, Function, Function, BiFunction, Function)`. ([#31296](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/31296))
- Added `TokenCredential.getTokenSync(TokenRequestContext)`. ([#31056](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/31056))

### Bugs Fixed

- Added a short delay to `AccessTokenCache.getToken()` to avoid an async-busy-loop when the first thread to retrieve a fresh token takes longer than usual and the cache is shared amongst many threads. ([#31110](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/31110))
- Fixed issue when deserializing InputStream from an HTTP response.

### Other Changes

- Defer creation of `XmlMapper` allowing for non-XML applications to exclude `jackson-dataformat-xml` dependency. ([#30663](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/30663))
