  to the `WritableByteChannel`/`AsynchronousByteChannel` while tracking the bytes written when a network error happens
  during consumption of the HTTP response body. ([#35004](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35004))

### Other Changes

#### Dependency Updates

- Upgraded `azure-core` from `1.39.0` to `1.40.0`.

### Other Changes

#### Dependency Updates

  proxy without using credentials (done to prevent any potential credential leaking). ([#30274](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/30274))

  ```java
