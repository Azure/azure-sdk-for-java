# Azure core test client library for Java

Library containing core classes used to test Azure SDK client libraries.

* Create live or playback JUnit tests using [TestBase][TestBase.java] and
  leveraging [InterceptorManager][InterceptorManager.java] to keep track of
  network calls.
* Record network calls using using pipeline policy,
  [RecordNetworkCallPolicy][RecordNetworkCallPolicy.java].
* Playback test session records with [PlaybackClient][PlaybackClient.java].

## Getting started

To use this package, add the following to your _pom.xml_.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-core-test</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-preview.6</version>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts

* [TestBase][TestBase.java]: Base test class that creates an `InterceptorManager` for each unit test and either plays
  back test session data or records the test session. Each session's file name is determined using the name of the test.
* [InterceptorManager][InterceptorManager.java]: Main class used to record and playback `NetworkCallRecords`.

## Examples

### Create a test class to run live or playback tests

Use [TestBase][TestBase.java] to easily create live and playback test cases. Extending from `TestBase` provides an
`interceptorManager` that keeps track of all network calls.

```java
// Set the AZURE_TEST_MODE environment variable to either PLAYBACK or RECORD to determine if tests are playback or
// live. By default, tests are run in playback mode.
public class SessionTests extends TestBase {
    @Test
    public void fooTest() {
        // Do some network calls.
    }
}
```

### Record network calls

Record network calls using [RecordNetworkCallPolicy][RecordNetworkCallPolicy.java]. Each HTTP request sent from the test
client, is persisted to [RecordedData][RecordedData.java].

```java
public class Foo {
    public void recordNetworkCalls() {
        // All network calls are kept in the networkData variable.
        RecordedData networkData = new RecordedData();
        HttpPipeline pipeline = new HttpPipeline(new RecordNetworkCallPolicy(recordedData));
    
        // Send requests through the HttpPipeline.
        pipeline.send(new HttpRequest(HttpMethod.GET, "http://bing.com"));
    
        // Get a record that was sent through the pipeline.
        NetworkCallRecord networkCall = networkData.findFirstAndRemoveNetworkCall(record -> {
            return record.uri().equals("http://bing.com");
        });
    }
}

```

### Playback session records

Playback test session records by creating a [RecordedData][RecordedData.java].

```java
public class Foo {
    public void playbackNetworkCalls() {
        RecordedData recordedData = new RecordedData();
    
        // Add some network calls to be replayed by playbackClient
    
        // Creates a HTTP client that plays back responses in recordedData.
        HttpClient playbackClient = new PlaybackClient(recordedData, null);
    
        // Send an HTTP GET request to http://bing.com. If recordedData contains a NetworkCallRecord with a matching HTTP
        // method and matching URL, it is returned as a response.
        Mono<HttpResponse> response = playbackClient.send(new HttpRequest(HttpMethod.GET, "http://bing.com"));
    }
}
```
