      HttpMethod.PUT, new URL("http://example.com"), new HttpHeaders(), BinaryData.fromString("sample body"))
  httpClient.send(request, context).subscribe();
  ```

  <br>To get the older behavior please create an instance of `HttpClient` as follows

    ```java
    HttpClient client = new OkHttpAsyncHttpClientBuilder()
        .followRedirects(true)
        .build();
    ```
