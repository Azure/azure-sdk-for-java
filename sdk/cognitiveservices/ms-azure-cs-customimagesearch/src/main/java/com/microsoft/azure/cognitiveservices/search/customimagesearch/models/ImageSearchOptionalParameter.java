     * If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple

     * Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
     * inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
     * different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
     * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to
     * that client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the
     * user. Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
     * analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
     * improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs
     * and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer.
     * IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required.
     * Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same end user
     * and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
     * consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better

     * and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time
     * that you should NOT include this header in a request is the first time
     * the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
     * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
     * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
     * cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a
     * session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's
     * persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your
