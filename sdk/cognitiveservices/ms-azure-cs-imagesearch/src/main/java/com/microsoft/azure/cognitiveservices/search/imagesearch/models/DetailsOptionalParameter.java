     * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to

     * user. Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
     * analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance

     * and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer.
     * IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required.
     * Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same end user
     * and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
     * consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
     * quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your
     * application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID.

     * and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time

     * the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing
     * API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the
     * client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP
     * cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a

     * persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your
