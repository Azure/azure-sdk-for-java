/**
 * Package containing the implementations for ElevationClient. The Azure Maps Elevation API provides an HTTP interface
 * to query elevation data on the surface of the Earth. Elevation data can be retrieved at specific locations by sending
 * lat/lon coordinates, by defining an ordered set of vertices that form a Polyline and a number of sample points along
 * the length of a Polyline, or by defining a bounding box that consists of equally spaced vertices as rows and columns.
 * The vertical datum is EPSG:3855. This datum uses the EGM2008 geoid model applied to the WGS84 ellipsoid as its zero
 * height reference surface. The vertical unit is measured in meters, the spatial resolution of the elevation data is
 * 0.8 arc-second for global coverage (~24 meters).
