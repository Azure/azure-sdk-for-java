     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will

     * original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response
     * also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The

     * request. Each item is of one of the following types:
     *

     * successfully.
     *
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.

     * The `Get Reverse Geocoding` API is an HTTP `GET` request used to translate a coordinate (example: 37.786505,
     * -122.3862) into a human understandable street address. Useful in tracking applications where you receive a GPS
     * feed from the device or asset and wish to know the address associated with the coordinates. This endpoint will
     * return address information for a given coordinate.
     *
     * @param coordinates The coordinates of the location that you want to reverse geocode. Example:
     * &amp;coordinates=lon,lat.
     * @param resultTypes Specify entity types that you want in the response. Only the types you specify will be
     * returned. If the point cannot be mapped to the entity types you specify, no location information is returned in
     * the response.
     * Default value is all possible entities.
     * A comma separated list of entity types selected from the following options.
     *
     * - Address
     * - Neighborhood
     * - PopulatedPlace
     * - Postcode1
     * - AdminDivision1
     * - AdminDivision2
     * - CountryRegion
     *
     * These entity types are ordered from the most specific entity to the least specific entity. When entities of more
     * than one entity type are found, only the most specific entity is returned. For example, if you specify Address
     * and AdminDistrict1 as entity types and entities were found for both types, only the Address entity information is
     * returned in the response.
     * @param view A string that represents an [ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 region/country
     * code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). This will alter Geopolitical disputed borders and labels
     * to align with the specified user region. By default, the View parameter is set to “Auto” even if you haven’t
     * defined it in the request.
     *
     * Please refer to [Supported Views](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsLocalizationViews) for details and to see the available
     * Views.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws HttpResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.

     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Reverse Geocoding](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding) API in a
     * single request.
     *
     *
     *
     * The `Get Reverse Geocoding Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of up to **100** queries to
     * [Reverse Geocoding](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding) API using a single request.
     *
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/reverseGeocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01
     * ```
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _reverse geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 2 _reverse geocoding_ queries:
     *
     *
     * ```
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "coordinates": [-122.128275, 47.639429],
     * "resultTypes": ["Address", "PopulatedPlace"]
     * },
     * {
     * "coordinates": [-122.341979399674, 47.6095253501216]
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * A _reverse geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _reverse geocoding_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding#uri-parameters).
     *
     *
     * The batch should contain at least **1** query.
     *
     *
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the
     * original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response
     * also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
     * `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch
     * request. Each item is of one of the following types:
     *
     * - [`GeocodingResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed
     * successfully.
     *
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *
     * @param reverseGeocodingBatchRequestBody The list of reverse geocoding queries/requests to process. The list can
     * contain a max of 100 queries and must contain at least 1 query.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws HttpResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
