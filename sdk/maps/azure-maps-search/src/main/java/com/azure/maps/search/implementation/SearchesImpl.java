     * The `Get Search Fuzzy` (**Free Form Search**) API, an HTTP `GET` request that seamlessly handles a combination of
     * [POI search](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-poi?view=rest-maps-1.0) and
     * [geocoding](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0). It is a Free Form Search API which

     * It can also be weighted with a contextual position (lat/lon pair), or fully constrained by a coordinate and
     * radius, or it can be executed more generally without any geo biasing anchor point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We strongly

     * Coverage](/azure/location-based-services/geocoding-coverage) for a complete list of all the supported
     * countries/regions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most Search queries default to `maxFuzzyLevel`=2 to gain performance and
     * also reduce unusual results. This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing in the query
     * param `maxFuzzyLevel`=3 or 4.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The applicable query string (e.g., "seattle", "pizza"). Can _also_ be specified as a comma separated
     * string composed by latitude followed by longitude (e.g., "47.641268, -122.125679"). Must be properly URL encoded.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.

     * specific Points of Interest categories. ID order does not matter. Maximum number of `categorySet` values
     * supported per request is 10. When multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least)
     * one of the categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be discovered
     * using [POI Categories](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. Usage examples:
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315** (Search Points of Interest from category Restaurant)
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
     * @param lon Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.
     * @param radiusInMeters The radius in meters to for the results to be constrained to the defined area.
     * @param topLeft Top left position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param btmRight Bottom right position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     * tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default language
     * is used.
     * 
     * Please refer to [Supported Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages) for

     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=PAD,Addr,POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=None
     * 
     * Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of an address. Availability is
     * region-dependent.
     * @param minFuzzyLevel Minimum fuzziness level to be used. Default: 1, minimum: 1 and maximum: 4
     *

     * = Points of interest, Str = Streets, Xstr = Cross Streets (intersections).
     * @param brandFilter A comma-separated list of brand names which could be used to restrict the result to specific
     * brands. Item order does not matter. When multiple brands are provided, only results that belong to (at least) one
     * of the provided list will be returned. Brands that contain a "," in their name should be put into quotes.

     * 
     * brandSet=Foo,Bar
     * 
     * brandSet="A,B,C Comma",Bar.

     * Standards](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets).
     * * `IEC62196Type1` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Yazaki after the
     * original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard that first published it. Mostly used in combination with
     * 120V single phase or up to 240V single phase infrastructure.
     * * `IEC62196Type1CCS` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CableAttached` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a cable and
     * plug attached to the charging point.
     * * `IEC62196Type2Outlet` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a socket set into
     * the charging point.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CCS` - Type 2 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 2 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type3` - Type 3 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Scame after the original
     * manufacturer. Mostly used in combination with up to 240V single phase or up to 420V three phase infrastructure.
     * * `Chademo` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and
     * industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the TEPCO's connector. It supports fast DC charging.
     * * `IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard. It is
     * sometime referred to as by some combination of the standard, the color and the fact that is a single phase
     * connector. The connector usually has the "P+N+E, 6h" configuration.
     * * `IEC60309DCWhite` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard.
     * * `Tesla` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla Supercharger connector. I.e. it refers to either
     * Tesla's proprietary connector, sometimes referred to as Tesla Port mostly limited to North America or the
     * modified Type 2 (DC over Type 2) in Europe.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * connectorSet=IEC62196Type2CableAttached
     * connectorSet=IEC62196Type2Outlet,IEC62196Type2CableAttached.
     * @param entityType Specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies. Narrows the search for specified
     * geography entity types, e.g. return only municipality. The resulting response will contain the geography ID as
     * well as the entity type matched. If you provide more than one entity as a comma separated list, endpoint will
     * return the 'smallest entity available'. Returned Geometry ID can be used to get the geometry of that geography
     * via [Get Search Polygon](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-polygon?view=rest-maps-1.0) API. The following
     * parameters are ignored when entityType is set:
     * 
     * * heading
     * * number
     * * returnRoadUse
     * * returnSpeedLimit
     * * roadUse
     * * returnMatchType.
     * @param localizedMapView The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the
     * correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries/regions have
     * different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required
     * by the country/region your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even
     * if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and
     * then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’,
     * which will return the map data based on the IP address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be
     * used in compliance with applicable laws, including those regarding mapping, of the country/region where maps,
     * images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to access via Azure Maps is made available.

     * Use when you need a search request that can handle combinations of addresses and POI tokens.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Search Fuzzy` (**Free Form Search**) API, an HTTP `GET` request that seamlessly handles a combination of
     * [POI search](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-poi?view=rest-maps-1.0) and
     * [geocoding](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0). It is a Free Form Search API which
     * handles fuzzy of inputs containing any combination of address or POI tokens as a canonical 'single line search'.
     * It can also be weighted with a contextual position (lat/lon pair), or fully constrained by a coordinate and
     * radius, or it can be executed more generally without any geo biasing anchor point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We strongly
     * advise you to use the 'countrySet' parameter to specify only the countries/regions for which your application
     * needs coverage, as the default behavior will be to search the entire world, potentially returning unnecessary
     * results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; E.g.: `countrySet`=US,FR &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please see [Search
     * Coverage](/azure/location-based-services/geocoding-coverage) for a complete list of all the supported
     * countries/regions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most Search queries default to `maxFuzzyLevel`=2 to gain performance and
     * also reduce unusual results. This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing in the query
     * param `maxFuzzyLevel`=3 or 4.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The applicable query string (e.g., "seattle", "pizza"). Can _also_ be specified as a comma separated
     * string composed by latitude followed by longitude (e.g., "47.641268, -122.125679"). Must be properly URL encoded.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.
     * @param categoryFilter A comma-separated list of category set IDs which could be used to restrict the result to
     * specific Points of Interest categories. ID order does not matter. Maximum number of `categorySet` values
     * supported per request is 10. When multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least)
     * one of the categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be discovered
     * using [POI Categories](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. Usage examples:
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315** (Search Points of Interest from category Restaurant)
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
     * @param lon Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.
     * @param radiusInMeters The radius in meters to for the results to be constrained to the defined area.
     * @param topLeft Top left position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param btmRight Bottom right position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     * tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default language
     * is used.
     * 
     * Please refer to [Supported Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages) for
     * details.
     * @param extendedPostalCodesFor Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included in the results.
     * 
     * Available indexes are:
     * 
     * **Addr** = Address ranges
     * 
     * **Geo** = Geographies
     * 
     * **PAD** = Point Addresses
     * 
     * **POI** = Points of Interest
     * 
     * **Str** = Streets
     * 
     * **XStr** = Cross Streets (intersections)
     * 
     * Value should be a comma separated list of index types (in any order) or **None** for no indexes.
     * 
     * By default extended postal codes are included for all indexes except Geo. Extended postal code lists for
     * geographies can be quite long so they have to be explicitly requested when needed.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=PAD,Addr,POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=None
     * 
     * Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of an address. Availability is
     * region-dependent.
     * @param minFuzzyLevel Minimum fuzziness level to be used. Default: 1, minimum: 1 and maximum: 4
     * 
     * * Level 1 has no spell checking.
     * 
     * * Level 2 uses normal n-gram spell checking. For example, query "restrant" can be matched to "restaurant."
     * 
     * * Level 3 uses sound-like spell checking, and shingle spell checking. Sound-like spell checking is for "rstrnt"
     * to "restaurant" matching. Shingle spell checking is for "mountainview" to "mountain view" matching.
     * 
     * * Level 4 doesn’t add any more spell checking functions.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The search engine will start looking for a match on the level defined by minFuzzyLevel, and will stop searching
     * at the level specified by maxFuzzyLevel.
     * @param maxFuzzyLevel Maximum fuzziness level to be used. Default: 2, minimum: 1 and maximum: 4
     * 
     * * Level 1 has no spell checking.
     * 
     * * Level 2 uses normal n-gram spell checking. For example, query "restrant" can be matched to "restaurant."
     * 
     * * Level 3 uses sound-like spell checking, and shingle spell checking. Sound-like spell checking is for "rstrnt"
     * to "restaurant" matching. Shingle spell checking is for "mountainview" to "mountain view" matching.
     * 
     * * Level 4 doesn’t add any more spell checking functions.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The search engine will start looking for a match on the level defined by minFuzzyLevel, and will stop searching
     * at the level specified by maxFuzzyLevel.
     * @param indexFilter A comma separated list of indexes which should be utilized for the search. Item order does not
     * matter. Available indexes are: Addr = Address range interpolation, Geo = Geographies, PAD = Point Addresses, POI
     * = Points of interest, Str = Streets, Xstr = Cross Streets (intersections).
     * @param brandFilter A comma-separated list of brand names which could be used to restrict the result to specific
     * brands. Item order does not matter. When multiple brands are provided, only results that belong to (at least) one
     * of the provided list will be returned. Brands that contain a "," in their name should be put into quotes.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * brandSet=Foo
     * 
     * brandSet=Foo,Bar
     * 
     * brandSet="A,B,C Comma",Bar.
     * @param electricVehicleConnectorFilter A comma-separated list of connector types which could be used to restrict
     * the result to Electric Vehicle Station supporting specific connector types. Item order does not matter. When
     * multiple connector types are provided, only results that belong to (at least) one of the provided list will be
     * returned.
     * 
     * Available connector types are:
     * * `StandardHouseholdCountrySpecific` - These are the standard household connectors for a certain region. They are
     * all AC single phase and the standard Voltage and standard Amperage. See also: [Plug &amp; socket types - World
     * Standards](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets).
     * * `IEC62196Type1` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Yazaki after the
     * original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard that first published it. Mostly used in combination with
     * 120V single phase or up to 240V single phase infrastructure.
     * * `IEC62196Type1CCS` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CableAttached` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a cable and
     * plug attached to the charging point.
     * * `IEC62196Type2Outlet` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a socket set into
     * the charging point.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CCS` - Type 2 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 2 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type3` - Type 3 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Scame after the original
     * manufacturer. Mostly used in combination with up to 240V single phase or up to 420V three phase infrastructure.
     * * `Chademo` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and
     * industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the TEPCO's connector. It supports fast DC charging.
     * * `IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard. It is
     * sometime referred to as by some combination of the standard, the color and the fact that is a single phase
     * connector. The connector usually has the "P+N+E, 6h" configuration.
     * * `IEC60309DCWhite` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard.
     * * `Tesla` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla Supercharger connector. I.e. it refers to either
     * Tesla's proprietary connector, sometimes referred to as Tesla Port mostly limited to North America or the
     * modified Type 2 (DC over Type 2) in Europe.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * connectorSet=IEC62196Type2CableAttached
     * connectorSet=IEC62196Type2Outlet,IEC62196Type2CableAttached.
     * @param entityType Specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies. Narrows the search for specified
     * geography entity types, e.g. return only municipality. The resulting response will contain the geography ID as
     * well as the entity type matched. If you provide more than one entity as a comma separated list, endpoint will
     * return the 'smallest entity available'. Returned Geometry ID can be used to get the geometry of that geography
     * via [Get Search Polygon](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-polygon?view=rest-maps-1.0) API. The following
     * parameters are ignored when entityType is set:
     * 
     * * heading
     * * number
     * * returnRoadUse
     * * returnSpeedLimit
     * * roadUse
     * * returnMatchType.
     * @param localizedMapView The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the
     * correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries/regions have
     * different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required
     * by the country/region your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even
     * if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and
     * then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’,
     * which will return the map data based on the IP address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be
     * used in compliance with applicable laws, including those regarding mapping, of the country/region where maps,
     * images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to access via Azure Maps is made available.
     * Example: view=IN.
     * 
     * Please refer to [Supported Views](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsLocalizationViews) for details and to see the available
     * Views.
     * @param operatingHours Hours of operation for a POI (Points of Interest). The availability of hours of operation
     * will vary based on the data available. If not passed, then no opening hours information will be returned.
     * Supported value: nextSevenDays.
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ErrorResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return this object is returned from a successful Search calls along with {@link Response} on successful
     * completion of {@link Mono}.

     * @param localizedMapView The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the
     * correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries/regions have
     * different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required
     * by the country/region your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even
     * if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and
     * then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’,

     * It can also be weighted with a contextual position (lat/lon pair), or fully constrained by a coordinate and
     * radius, or it can be executed more generally without any geo biasing anchor point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We strongly

     * Coverage](/azure/location-based-services/geocoding-coverage) for a complete list of all the supported
     * countries/regions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most Search queries default to `maxFuzzyLevel`=2 to gain performance and
     * also reduce unusual results. This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing in the query
     * param `maxFuzzyLevel`=3 or 4.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The applicable query string (e.g., "seattle", "pizza"). Can _also_ be specified as a comma separated
     * string composed by latitude followed by longitude (e.g., "47.641268, -122.125679"). Must be properly URL encoded.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.
     * @param categoryFilter A comma-separated list of category set IDs which could be used to restrict the result to

     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.

     * 
     * The `Points of Interest (POI) Search` API is an HTTP `GET` request that allows you to request POI results by
     * name. It also supports additional query parameters such as language and filtering results by area of interest
     * driven by country/region or bounding box. The Endpoint will return only POI results matching the query string.
     * Response includes POI details such as address, coordinate location and category.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The POI name to search for (e.g., "statue of liberty", "starbucks"), must be properly URL encoded.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.
     * @param categoryFilter A comma-separated list of category set IDs which could be used to restrict the result to
     * specific Points of Interest categories. ID order does not matter. Maximum number of `categorySet` values
     * supported per request is 10. When multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least)
     * one of the categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be discovered
     * using [POI Categories](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. Usage examples:
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315** (Search Points of Interest from category Restaurant)
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
     * @param lon Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.
     * @param radiusInMeters The radius in meters to for the results to be constrained to the defined area.
     * @param topLeft Top left position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param btmRight Bottom right position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     * tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default language
     * is used.
     * 
     * Please refer to [Supported Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages) for
     * details.
     * @param extendedPostalCodesFor Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included in the results.
     * 
     * Available indexes are:
     * 
     * **POI** = Points of Interest
     * 
     * Value should be **POI** or **None** to disable extended postal codes.
     * 
     * By default extended postal codes are included.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=None
     * 
     * Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of an address. Availability is
     * region-dependent.
     * @param brandFilter A comma-separated list of brand names which could be used to restrict the result to specific
     * brands. Item order does not matter. When multiple brands are provided, only results that belong to (at least) one
     * of the provided list will be returned. Brands that contain a "," in their name should be put into quotes.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * brandSet=Foo
     * 
     * brandSet=Foo,Bar
     * 
     * brandSet="A,B,C Comma",Bar.
     * @param electricVehicleConnectorFilter A comma-separated list of connector types which could be used to restrict

     * Standards](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets).
     * * `IEC62196Type1` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Yazaki after the
     * original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard that first published it. Mostly used in combination with
     * 120V single phase or up to 240V single phase infrastructure.
     * * `IEC62196Type1CCS` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CableAttached` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a cable and
     * plug attached to the charging point.

     * @param localizedMapView The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the
     * correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries/regions have
     * different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required
     * by the country/region your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even
     * if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and
     * then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’,

     * @param localizedMapView The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the
     * correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries/regions have
     * different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required
     * by the country/region your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even
     * if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and
     * then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’,
     * which will return the map data based on the IP address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be
     * used in compliance with applicable laws, including those regarding mapping, of the country/region where maps,
     * images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to access via Azure Maps is made available.
     * Example: view=IN.
     *

     * category. Useful to query POIs from one category at a time. Endpoint will only return POI results which are
     * categorized as specified. Response includes POI details such as address, coordinate location and classification.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The POI category to search for (e.g., "AIRPORT", "RESTAURANT"), must be properly URL encoded.
     * Supported main categories can be requested by calling [Get Search POI Category
     * Tree](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. For a list of available categories, see [Azure Maps supported
     * categories](/azure/azure-maps/supported-search-categories). We recommend to use POI Search Category Tree API to
     * request the supported categories.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.
     * @param categoryFilter A comma-separated list of category set IDs which could be used to restrict the result to
     * specific Points of Interest categories. ID order does not matter. Maximum number of `categorySet` values
     * supported per request is 10. When multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least)
     * one of the categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be discovered
     * using [POI Categories](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. Usage examples:

     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
     * @param lon Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.
     * @param radiusInMeters The radius in meters to for the results to be constrained to the defined area.
     * @param topLeft Top left position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param btmRight Bottom right position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language

     * 
     * The `Get Search POI Category` API is an HTTP `GET` request that allows you to request POI results from given
     * category. Useful to query POIs from one category at a time. Endpoint will only return POI results which are
     * categorized as specified. Response includes POI details such as address, coordinate location and classification.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The POI category to search for (e.g., "AIRPORT", "RESTAURANT"), must be properly URL encoded.
     * Supported main categories can be requested by calling [Get Search POI Category
     * Tree](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. For a list of available categories, see [Azure Maps supported
     * categories](/azure/azure-maps/supported-search-categories). We recommend to use POI Search Category Tree API to
     * request the supported categories.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.
     * @param categoryFilter A comma-separated list of category set IDs which could be used to restrict the result to
     * specific Points of Interest categories. ID order does not matter. Maximum number of `categorySet` values
     * supported per request is 10. When multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least)
     * one of the categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be discovered
     * using [POI Categories](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. Usage examples:
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315** (Search Points of Interest from category Restaurant)
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
     * @param lon Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.

    /**
     * Use to search for points of interest by category.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Search POI Category` API is an HTTP `GET` request that allows you to request POI results from given
     * category. Useful to query POIs from one category at a time. Endpoint will only return POI results which are
     * categorized as specified. Response includes POI details such as address, coordinate location and classification.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param query The POI category to search for (e.g., "AIRPORT", "RESTAURANT"), must be properly URL encoded.
     * Supported main categories can be requested by calling [Get Search POI Category
     * Tree](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. For a list of available categories, see [Azure Maps supported
     * categories](/azure/azure-maps/supported-search-categories). We recommend to use POI Search Category Tree API to
     * request the supported categories.
     * @param isTypeAhead Boolean. If the typeahead flag is set, the query will be interpreted as a partial input and
     * the search will enter predictive mode.
     * @param top Maximum number of responses that will be returned. Default: 10, minimum: 1 and maximum: 100.
     * @param skip Starting offset of the returned results within the full result set. Default: 0.
     * @param categoryFilter A comma-separated list of category set IDs which could be used to restrict the result to
     * specific Points of Interest categories. ID order does not matter. Maximum number of `categorySet` values
     * supported per request is 10. When multiple category identifiers are provided, only POIs that belong to (at least)
     * one of the categories from the provided list will be returned. The list of supported categories can be discovered
     * using [POI Categories](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPOICategoryTree) API. Usage examples:
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315** (Search Points of Interest from category Restaurant)
     * 
     * * **categorySet=7315025,7315017** (Search Points of Interest of category either Italian or French Restaurant).
     * @param countryFilter Comma separated string of country/region codes, e.g. FR,ES. This will limit the search to
     * the specified countries/regions.
     * @param lat Latitude where results should be biased. E.g. 37.337.
     * @param lon Longitude where results should be biased. E.g. -121.89.
     * @param radiusInMeters The radius in meters to for the results to be constrained to the defined area.
     * @param topLeft Top left position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param btmRight Bottom right position of the bounding box. E.g. 37.553,-122.453.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     * tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default language
     * is used.
     * 
     * Please refer to [Supported Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages) for
     * details.
     * @param extendedPostalCodesFor Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included in the results.
     * 
     * Available indexes are:
     * 
     * **Addr** = Address ranges
     * 
     * **Geo** = Geographies
     * 
     * **PAD** = Point Addresses
     * 
     * **POI** = Points of Interest
     * 
     * **Str** = Streets
     * 
     * **XStr** = Cross Streets (intersections)
     * 
     * Value should be a comma separated list of index types (in any order) or **None** for no indexes.
     * 
     * By default extended postal codes are included for all indexes except Geo. Extended postal code lists for
     * geographies can be quite long so they have to be explicitly requested when needed.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=PAD,Addr,POI
     * 
     * extendedPostalCodesFor=None
     * 
     * Extended postal code is returned as an **extendedPostalCode** property of an address. Availability is
     * region-dependent.
     * @param brandFilter A comma-separated list of brand names which could be used to restrict the result to specific
     * brands. Item order does not matter. When multiple brands are provided, only results that belong to (at least) one
     * of the provided list will be returned. Brands that contain a "," in their name should be put into quotes.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * brandSet=Foo
     * 
     * brandSet=Foo,Bar
     * 
     * brandSet="A,B,C Comma",Bar.
     * @param electricVehicleConnectorFilter A comma-separated list of connector types which could be used to restrict
     * the result to Electric Vehicle Station supporting specific connector types. Item order does not matter. When
     * multiple connector types are provided, only results that belong to (at least) one of the provided list will be
     * returned.
     * 
     * Available connector types are:
     * * `StandardHouseholdCountrySpecific` - These are the standard household connectors for a certain region. They are
     * all AC single phase and the standard Voltage and standard Amperage. See also: [Plug &amp; socket types - World
     * Standards](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets).
     * * `IEC62196Type1` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Yazaki after the
     * original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard that first published it. Mostly used in combination with
     * 120V single phase or up to 240V single phase infrastructure.
     * * `IEC62196Type1CCS` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CableAttached` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a cable and
     * plug attached to the charging point.

     * the charging point.
     * * `IEC62196Type2CCS` - Type 2 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is
     * based on the Type 2 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC)
     * contacts to allow DC fast charging.
     * * `IEC62196Type3` - Type 3 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Scame after the original
     * manufacturer. Mostly used in combination with up to 240V single phase or up to 420V three phase infrastructure.
     * * `Chademo` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and
     * industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the TEPCO's connector. It supports fast DC charging.
     * * `IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard. It is
     * sometime referred to as by some combination of the standard, the color and the fact that is a single phase
     * connector. The connector usually has the "P+N+E, 6h" configuration.
     * * `IEC60309DCWhite` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard.
     * * `Tesla` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla Supercharger connector. I.e. it refers to either
     * Tesla's proprietary connector, sometimes referred to as Tesla Port mostly limited to North America or the
     * modified Type 2 (DC over Type 2) in Europe.
     * 
     * Usage examples:
     * 
     * connectorSet=IEC62196Type2CableAttached
     * connectorSet=IEC62196Type2Outlet,IEC62196Type2CableAttached.
     * @param localizedMapView The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the
     * correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries/regions have
     * different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required
     * by the country/region your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even
     * if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and
     * then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’,
     * which will return the map data based on the IP address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be
     * used in compliance with applicable laws, including those regarding mapping, of the country/region where maps,
     * images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to access via Azure Maps is made available.
     * Example: view=IN.
     * 
     * Please refer to [Supported Views](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsLocalizationViews) for details and to see the available
     * Views.
     * @param operatingHours Hours of operation for a POI (Points of Interest). The availability of hours of operation
     * will vary based on the data available. If not passed, then no opening hours information will be returned.
     * Supported value: nextSevenDays.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ErrorResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return this object is returned from a successful Search calls.

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous call. You can call
     * `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous call. You can call
     * `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {

     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous call. You can call
     * `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous call. You can call
     * Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller
     * to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {

     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous call. You can call
     * Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller
     * to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {

     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous call. You can call
     * Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller
     * to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Fuzzy Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous call. You can call
     * Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller
     * to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [

     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Fuzzy Batch` API is and HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You can
     * call Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     *

     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a

     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     *

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Fuzzy Batch` API is and HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You can
     * call Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {

     * {
     * "error":

     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,
     * "response":
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "query": "atm"
     * },
     * "results": [
     * {
     * "type": "POI",
     * "poi": {
     * "name": "ATM at Wells Fargo"
     * },
     * "address": {
     * "country": "United States Of America",
     * "freeformAddress": "3240 157th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052"

     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * },

     * "query": "statue of liberty"
     * },
     * "results": [

     * "freeformAddress": "New York, NY 10004"
     * }
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * },
     * {
     * "statusCode": 400,
     * "response":
     * {
     * "error":
     * {
     * "code": "400 BadRequest",
     * "message": "Bad request: one or more parameters were incorrectly specified or are mutually exclusive."
     * }
     * }

     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Fuzzy Batch` API is and HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You can
     * call Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Fuzzy Batch` API is and HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You can
     * call Search Fuzzy Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [

     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Fuzzy Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search fuzzy_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search fuzzy_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=atm&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=5"},
     * {"query": "?query=Statue Of Liberty&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=Starbucks&amp;lat=47.639769&amp;lon=-122.128362&amp;radius=5000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Space Needle"},
     * {"query": "?query=pizza&amp;limit=10"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search fuzzy_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search fuzzy_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search fuzzy_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also be
     * properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/fuzzy/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressresult) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,
     * "response":

     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

     * }
     * }

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * **Search Address Batch API**
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Batch sync` API sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     *

     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will

     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Fuzzy](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-fuzzy?view=rest-maps-1.0)
     * API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * **Search Address Batch API**
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Batch sync` API sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

     * }

     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},

     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [

     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,
     * "response":

     * }
     * }
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```.
     *

     * @param batchRequest The list of address geocoding queries/requests to process. The list can contain a max of
     * 10,000 queries and must contain at least 1 query.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws HttpResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.

     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,
     * "response":

     * ]
     * }
     * },

     * }
     * }
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     *

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,

     * "message": "Bad request: one or more parameters were incorrectly specified or are mutually exclusive."
     * }
     * }
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param batchRequest The list of address geocoding queries/requests to process. The list can contain a max of
     * 10,000 queries and must contain at least 1 query.

     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {

     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,
     * "response":
     * {
     * "summary": {

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {

     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052&amp;limit=3"},
     * {"query": "?query=350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118&amp;limit=1"},
     * {"query": "?query=Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101&amp;lat=47.610970&amp;lon=-122.342469&amp;radius=1000"},
     * {"query": "?query=Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France&amp;limit=1"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and
     * subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string values in the
     * _search address_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it should also
     * be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,
     * "response":
     * {
     * "summary": {

     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * },

     * ]
     * }
     * },

     * "message": "Bad request: one or more parameters were incorrectly specified or are mutually exclusive."
     * }
     * }
     * }

     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`SearchAddressResult`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0#SearchAddressResult) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "statusCode": 200,

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Reverse Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async
     * API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     *

     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Reverse Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async
     * API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous request.
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single synchronous API call. You
     * can call Search Address Reverse Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async
     * API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},

     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},

     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Post Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },

     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
     * "batchItems": [

     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Search Address
     * Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single asynchronous
     * request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to [Search
     * Address Reverse](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0) API in a single
     * asynchronous API call. You can call `Get Search Address Reverse Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async)
     * or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100**
     * queries.
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex search requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **10,000** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Search Address Reverse Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * 
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _search address reverse_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
     * the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 5 _search address reverse_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {"query": "?query=48.858561,2.294911"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.639765,-122.127896&amp;radius=5000&amp;limit=2"},
     * {"query": "?query=47.621028,-122.348170"},
     * {"query": "?query=43.722990,10.396695"},
     * {"query": "?query=40.750958,-73.982336"}
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _search address reverse_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _search address reverse_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#uri-parameters). The string
     * values in the _search address reverse_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\
     * ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **10,000** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/address/reverse/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * -
     * [`SearchAddressReverseResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-address-reverse?view=rest-maps-1.0#searchaddressreverseresponse)
     * - If the query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 2 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 2,
     * "totalRequests": 3
     * },
