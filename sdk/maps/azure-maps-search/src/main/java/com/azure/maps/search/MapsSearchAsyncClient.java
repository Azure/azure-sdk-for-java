     *
     *
     *
     * The `Get Geocoding Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of up to **100** queries to the
     * [Geocoding](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding) API in a single request.
     *
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/geocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01
     * ```
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 2 _geocoding_ queries:
     *
     *
     * ```
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "addressLine": "One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052",
     * "top": 2
     * },
     * {
     * "addressLine": "Pike Pl",
     * "adminDistrict": "WA",
     * "locality": "Seattle",
     * "top": 3
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * A _geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _geocoding_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding#uri-parameters).
     *
     *
     * The batch should contain at least **1** query.
     *
     *
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the
     * original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response
     * also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
     * `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch
     * request. Each item is of one of the following types:
     *
     * - [`GeocodingResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed
     * successfully.
     *
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *

     *
     *
     *
     * The `Get Geocoding Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of up to **100** queries to the
     * [Geocoding](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding) API in a single request.
     *
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/geocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01
     * ```
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 2 _geocoding_ queries:
     *
     *
     * ```
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "addressLine": "One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052",

     * "locality": "Seattle",

     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding#uri-parameters).
     *
     *
     * The batch should contain at least **1** query.
     *
     *
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the
     * original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response
     * also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
     * `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch
     * request. Each item is of one of the following types:
     *
     * - [`GeocodingResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed
     * successfully.
     *
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.

     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/reverseGeocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01
     * ```
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _reverse geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 2 _reverse geocoding_ queries:
     *
     *
     * ```
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * {
     * "coordinates": [-122.128275, 47.639429],
     * "resultTypes": ["Address", "PopulatedPlace"]
     * },
     * {
     * "coordinates": [-122.341979399674, 47.6095253501216]
     * }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * A _reverse geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _reverse geocoding_ [URI
     * parameters](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding#uri-parameters).
     *
     *
     * The batch should contain at least **1** query.
     *
     *
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the
     * original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response
     * also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The
     * `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch
     * request. Each item is of one of the following types:
     *
     * - [`GeocodingResponse`](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed
     * successfully.
     *
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *
     * @param reverseGeocodingBatchRequestBody The list of reverse geocoding queries/requests to process. The list can
     * contain a max of 100 queries and must contain at least 1 query.
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws HttpResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return this object is returned from a successful Geocoding Batch service call along with {@link Response} on
     * successful completion of {@link Mono}.
