Nicole\\nwill is expected to exit southwest Georgia Friday morning.\\n\\nTropical storm conditions are entering the Southeast Florida Big Bend,\\nincluding the adjacent coastal areas this morning. Tropical storm\\nconditions will continue spreading northward over the rest of the\\nFlorida Big Bend and Southwest Georgia from late this morning into\\nthis evening, where Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect.\\n\\nDangerous storm surge is possible along the shorelines of Apalachee\\nBay. Storm Surge Warnings remain in effect from the Ochlockonee River\\nto the mouth of the Suwannee River. Storm Surge Watches remain in\\neffect from Indian Pass to the Ochlockonee River. Normally dry land\\nnear the shoreline could experience 3 to 5 feet of inundation,\\nespecially east of the Ochlockonee River.\\n\\nStorm total rainfall of 2 to 3 inches will be a concern for all areas\\neast of a line from Dothan to Apalachicola. A lack of recent rainfall\\nwill allow the ground to absorb some of the heavy rain, however,\\ntorrential rainfall over a short period of time leading to isolated\\nhigher amounts could lead to isolated flash flooding.\\n\\nIsolated tornadoes are possible east of the I-75 corridor in south\\nGeorgia.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\\n-----------------\\n\\n* WIND:\\nProtect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across\\neastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend, southeastern Alabama and\\nsouthwestern Georgia. Potential impacts include:\\n    - Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\\n      mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\\n    - Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\\n      uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are\\n      shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.\\n    - A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban\\n      or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on\\n      bridges and other elevated roadways.\\n    - Scattered power and communications outages.\\n\\n* SURGE:\\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible significant\\nimpacts from the Ochlockonee River to the mouth of the Suwannee\\nRiver. Potential impacts in this area include:\\n    - Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by\\n      waves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.\\n    - Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become\\n      weakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low\\n      spots.\\n    - Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and\\n      numerous rip currents.\\n    - Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.\\n      Several small craft broken away from moorings, especially in\\n      unprotected anchorages.\\n\\nAlso, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited\\nimpacts along the shore of Franklin County.\\n\\nElsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,\\nsoutheastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, little to no impact is\\nanticipated.\\n\\n* FLOODING RAIN:\\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible\\nsignificant impacts east of a line from Dothan to Apalachicola.\\nPotential impacts include:\\n    - Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\\n      rescues.\\n    - Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\\n      currents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\\n      in usually vulnerable spots.

Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\\n      storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\\n      become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\\n\\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\\nlimited impacts across the Florida Panhandle and portions of Southeastern\\nAlabama.\\n\\n* TORNADOES:\\nProtect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts\\neast of the I-75 corridor of Southwestern Georgia. Potential impacts\\ninclude:\\n    - The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\\n      of emergency plans during tropical events.\\n    - A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\\n      and communications disruptions.\\n    - Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\\n      toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\\n      large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\\n      knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\\n      pulled from moorings.\\n\\nElsewhere across the eastern Florida panhandle, Florida Big Bend,\\nsoutheastern Alabama, and southwestern Georgia west of I-75, little\\nto no impact is anticipated.\\n\\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n* EVACUATIONS:\\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\\nimmediately.\\n\\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help\\nkeep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.\\n\\nDo not enter evacuated areas until officials have given the all\\nclear to return.\\n\\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\\n\\nKeep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles\\ncan be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide\\npoisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly\\nventilated area.\\n\\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.\\n\\nIf a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter\\nquickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not\\nprone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter\\noptions.\\n\\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\\non a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of\\nstrong winds or flooding.\\n\\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets\\nfor official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes\\nto the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather\\nwarnings.\\n\\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\\n\\nNEXT UPDATE\\n-----------\\n\\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\\nService in Tallahassee FL around 4 PM ET, or sooner if conditions\\nwarrant.\",\"alertDetailsLanguageCode\":\"en\"}]}]}",
