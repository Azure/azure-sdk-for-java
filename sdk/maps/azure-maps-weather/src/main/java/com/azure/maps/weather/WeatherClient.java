     * <p>Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts,
     * weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. This includes a
     * list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might

     * endpoint.
     *
     * <p>In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an
     * increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy
     * rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing

     * `Latitude` - Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees. * `Longitude` - Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.
     * * `ETA (estimated time of arrival)` - The number of minutes from the present time that it will take for the
     * vehicle to reach the waypoint. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 120.0 minutes. * `Heading` - An optional value
     * indicating the vehicle heading as it passes the waypoint. Expressed in clockwise degrees relative to true

     * <p>There may be times when you want to know if the weather conditions are optimal for a specific activity, for
     * example, for outdoor construction, indoor activities, running or farming including soil moisture information.
     * Azure Maps Indices API returns index values that will guide end users to plan future activities. For example, a
     * health mobile application can notify users that today is good weather for running or for other outdoors
     * activities like for playing golf, and retail stores can optimize their digital marketing campaigns based on
     * predicted index values. The service returns in daily indices values for current and next 5, 10 and 15 days
     * starting from current day.
     *
     * @param position The applicable query specified as a comma separated string composed by longitude followed by
     * latitude e.g. "-122.125679,47.641268".
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     * tags, case-insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default
     * language is used.
     * <p>Please refer to [Supported Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages) for
     * details.
     * @param duration Specifies for how many days the daily indices are returned. By default, the indices data for the
     * current day will be returned. When requesting future indices data, the current day is included in the
     * response as day 1. Available values are * `1` - Return daily index data for the current day. Default value. *
     * `5` - Return 5 days of daily index data starting from the current day. * `10` - Return 10 days of daily index
     * data starting from the current day. * `15` - Return 15 days of daily index data starting from the current
     * day.
     * @param indexId Numeric index identifier that can be used for restricting returned results to the corresponding
     * index type. Cannot be paired with `indexGroupId`. Please refer to [Weather Service
     * Concepts](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsWeatherConcepts) for details and to see the supported indices.
     * @param indexGroupId Numeric index group identifier that can be used for restricting returned results to the
     * corresponding subset of indices (index group). Cannot be paired with `indexId`. Please refer to [Weather
     * Service Concepts](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsWeatherConcepts) for details and to see the supported index groups.
