     * <p>**Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
     *
     * <p>Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts,
     * weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. This includes a
     * list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might
     * be used to paint each portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When submitting the
     * waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
     * shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes.
     *
     * <p>The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows
     * you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route
     * endpoint.
     *
     * <p>In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an
     * increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy
     * rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing
     * the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint. The trigger for
     * when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a
     * [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the
     * waypoint.
     *
     * <p>The API covers all regions of the planet except latitudes above Greenland and Antarctica.
     *
     * @param waypoints Coordinates through which the route is calculated, separated by colon (:) and entered in
     * chronological order. A minimum of two waypoints is required. A single API call may contain up to 60
     * waypoints. A waypoint indicates location, ETA, and optional heading: latitude,longitude,ETA,heading, where *
     * `Latitude` - Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees. * `Longitude` - Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.
     * * `ETA (estimated time of arrival)` - The number of minutes from the present time that it will take for the
     * vehicle to reach the waypoint. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 120.0 minutes. * `Heading` - An optional value
     * indicating the vehicle heading as it passes the waypoint. Expressed in clockwise degrees relative to true
     * north. This is issued to calculate sun glare as a driving hazard. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees.
     * If not provided, a heading will automatically be derived based on the position of neighboring waypoints.
     * <p>It is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
     * shortly after. This way a more accurate assessment can be provided for the trip and prevent isolated events
     * not being captured between waypoints. Information can and should be updated along the route (especially for
     * trips greater than 2 hours) to continuously pull new waypoints moving forward, but also to ensure that
     * forecast information for content such as precipitation type and intensity is accurate as storms develop and
     * dissipate over time.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     * tags, case-insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default
     * language is used.

     *
     * <p>Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts,
     * weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. This includes a
     * list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might
     * be used to paint each portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When submitting the
     * waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
     * shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes.
     *
     * <p>The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows
     * you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route
     * endpoint.
     *
     * <p>In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an
     * increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy
     * rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing
     * the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint. The trigger for
     * when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a
     * [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the
     * waypoint.
     *
     * <p>The API covers all regions of the planet except latitudes above Greenland and Antarctica.
     *
     * @param waypoints Coordinates through which the route is calculated, separated by colon (:) and entered in
     * chronological order. A minimum of two waypoints is required. A single API call may contain up to 60
     * waypoints. A waypoint indicates location, ETA, and optional heading: latitude,longitude,ETA,heading, where *
     * `Latitude` - Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees. * `Longitude` - Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.
     * * `ETA (estimated time of arrival)` - The number of minutes from the present time that it will take for the
     * vehicle to reach the waypoint. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 120.0 minutes. * `Heading` - An optional value
     * indicating the vehicle heading as it passes the waypoint. Expressed in clockwise degrees relative to true
     * north. This is issued to calculate sun glare as a driving hazard. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees.
     * If not provided, a heading will automatically be derived based on the position of neighboring waypoints.
     * <p>It is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
     * shortly after. This way a more accurate assessment can be provided for the trip and prevent isolated events
     * not being captured between waypoints. Information can and should be updated along the route (especially for
     * trips greater than 2 hours) to continuously pull new waypoints moving forward, but also to ensure that
     * forecast information for content such as precipitation type and intensity is accurate as storms develop and
     * dissipate over time.
