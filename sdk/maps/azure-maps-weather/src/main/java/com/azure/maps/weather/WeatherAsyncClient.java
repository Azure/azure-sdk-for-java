     * <p>Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts,
     * weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. This includes a
     * list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might
     * be used to paint each portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When submitting the
     * waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
     * shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes.
     *
     * <p>The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows
     * you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route
     * endpoint.
     *
     * <p>In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an
     * increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy
     * rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing
     * the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint. The trigger for
     * when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a
     * [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the

     *

     *     `Latitude` - Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees. * `Longitude` - Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.
     *     * `ETA (estimated time of arrival)` - The number of minutes from the present time that it will take for the
     *     vehicle to reach the waypoint. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 120.0 minutes. * `Heading` - An optional value
     *     indicating the vehicle heading as it passes the waypoint. Expressed in clockwise degrees relative to true
     *     north. This is issued to calculate sun glare as a driving hazard. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees.
     *     If not provided, a heading will automatically be derived based on the position of neighboring waypoints.
     *     <p>It is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or
