# Azure Maps SDK client library for Java

Azure Maps SDK Client library for Java.

Microsoft Azure Maps provides developers from all industries with powerful geospatial capabilities. Those geospatial capabilities are packed with the freshest mapping data. Azure Maps is available for both web and mobile applications. Azure Maps is an Azure One API compliant set of REST APIs. For more information please see [Azure Maps Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/)

## Getting started

To get started with a specific library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. 
- [Azure Maps Search](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-search/README.md) contains Search APIs for querying addresses, nearby locations, geopolygons etc.
- [Azure Maps Route](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-route/README.md) contains Route APIs for calculating matrix of route summaries, returning routes between destinations, etc.
- [Azure Maps Render](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-render/README.md) contains Render APIs to request map tiles, metadata for tilesets, etc.

## Key concepts

See [API design][design] for general introduction on design and key concepts on Azure Management Libraries.

## Examples

For examples of each module please see:
- [Azure Maps Search Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-search/src/samples) 
- [Azure Maps Route Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-route/src/samples)
- [Azure Maps Render Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/maps/azure-maps-render/src/samples)

## Troubleshooting
When you interact with the Azure Maps Services, errors returned by the Maps service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for REST API requests.

For example, if you search with an invalid coordinate, a error is returned, indicating "Bad Request".400
