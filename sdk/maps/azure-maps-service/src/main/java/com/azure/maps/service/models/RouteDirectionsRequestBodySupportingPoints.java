 * A GeoJSON Geometry collection representing sequence of coordinates used as input for route reconstruction and for
 * calculating zero or more alternative routes to this reference route. - The provided sequence of supporting points is
 * used as input for route reconstruction. - The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination
 * points specified in the base path parameter locations. - If both _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ are
 * set to zero, then these origin and destination points are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of
 * the reference route, respectively. - Intermediate locations (_waypoints_) are not supported when using
 * &lt;_supportingPoints_&gt;. - The reference route may contain traffic incidents of type _ROAD_CLOSURE_, which are
 * ignored for the calculation of the reference route's travel time and traffic delay.
