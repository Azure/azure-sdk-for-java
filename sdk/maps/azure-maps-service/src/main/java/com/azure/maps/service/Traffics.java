     * valid for two minutes before it times out. It is used in rendering [incident

     *
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.

     *     API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/traffic/gettrafficincidenttile). This will have an effect
     *     on the coordinates of traffic incidents in the reply.
     * @param boundingbox The `boundingbox` is represented by two value pairs describing it's corners (first pair for
     *     lower left corner and second for upper right). The pairs can either be specified using any of the
     *     `projection`'s specified below (e.g., _minY,minX,maxY,maxX_) or by two latitude-longitude pairs (e.g.,
     *     _minLat,minLon,maxLat,maxLon_).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: If latitude/longitude pairs are used, then the

     * @param boundingbox Bounding box of the map viewport in
     *     [EPSG900913](http://docs.openlayers.org/library/spherical_mercator.html) projection. The `boundingbox` is
     *     represented by two value pairs describing it's corners (first pair for lower left corner and second for upper
     *     right). All values should be separated by commas (e.g., _minY,minX,maxY,maxX_). The maximum size of the
     *     bounding box that can be passed is dependent on the requested zoom level. The width and height cannot exceed
     *     4092 pixels when rendered on the given zoom level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: Bounding boxes that cross the
     *     180° meridian require special treatment. For such boxes, the eastern _maxX_ value will be negative, and thus
     *     less than the _minX_ value west of the 180° meridian. To address that, the value 40075016.6855874 should be
     *     added to the true _maxX_ value before it is passed in the request.
     * @param boundingzoom Zoom level of the map viewport. Used to determine whether the view can be zoomed in.
     * @param overviewbox Bounding box of the overview map in
     *     [EPSG900913](http://docs.openlayers.org/library/spherical_mercator.html) projection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used
     *     in case the overview box/mini map has different copyright data than the main map. If there is no mini map,
     *     the same coordinates as `boundingBox` is used.
     * @param overviewzoom Zoom level of the overview map. If there is no mini map, use the same zoom level as
     *     boundingZoom.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ErrorResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return this object is returned from a successful Traffic Incident Viewport call.
