     * <p>The Get Map Tiles API allows users to request map tiles in vector or raster formats typically to be integrated
     * into a map control or SDK. Some example tiles that can be requested are Azure Maps road tiles, real-time Weather
     * Radar tiles or the map tiles created using [Azure Maps Creator](https://aka.ms/amcreator). By default, Azure Maps
     * uses vector tiles for its web map control (Web SDK) and Android SDK.
     *
     * @param tilesetId A tileset is a collection of raster or vector data broken up into a uniform grid of square tiles
     *     at preset zoom levels. Every tileset has a **tilesetId** to use when making requests. The **tilesetId** for
     *     tilesets created using [Azure Maps Creator](https://aka.ms/amcreator) are generated through the [Tileset
     *     Create API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/tileset). The ready-to-use tilesets supplied by
     *     Azure Maps are listed below. For example, microsoft.base.
     * @param zoom Zoom level for the desired tile. Please find TilesetID list below for more details on supported zoom
     *     level for each tilesetId.&lt;br&gt;
     *     <p>Please see [Zoom Levels and Tile
     *     Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/location-based-services/zoom-levels-and-tile-grid) for details.
     * @param xTileIndex X coordinate of the tile on zoom grid. Value must be in the range [0,
     *     2&lt;sup&gt;`zoom`&lt;/sup&gt; -1].
     *     <p>Please see [Zoom Levels and Tile
     *     Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/location-based-services/zoom-levels-and-tile-grid) for details.
     * @param yTileIndex Y coordinate of the tile on zoom grid. Value must be in the range [0,
     *     2&lt;sup&gt;`zoom`&lt;/sup&gt; -1].
     *     <p>Please see [Zoom Levels and Tile
     *     Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/location-based-services/zoom-levels-and-tile-grid) for details.
     * @param timeStamp The desired date and time of the requested tile. This parameter must be specified in the
     *     standard date-time format (e.g. 2019-11-14T16:03:00-08:00), as defined by [ISO
     *     8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). This parameter is only supported when tilesetId parameter is
     *     set to one of the values below.
     *     <p>* microsoft.weather.infrared.main: We provide tiles up to 3 hours in the past. Tiles are available in
     *     10-minute intervals. We round the timeStamp value to the nearest 10-minute time frame. *
     *     microsoft.weather.radar.main: We provide tiles up to 1.5 hours in the past and up to 2 hours in the future.
     *     Tiles are available in 5-minute intervals. We round the timeStamp value to the nearest 5-minute time frame.
     * @param tileSize The size of the returned map tile in pixels.
     * @param language Language in which search results should be returned. Should be one of supported IETF language
     *     tags, case insensitive. When data in specified language is not available for a specific field, default
     *     language is used.
     *     <p>Please refer to [Supported
     *     Languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages) for details.
     * @param view The View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps
     *     services, including borders and labels displayed on the map. The View parameter (also referred to as “user
     *     region parameter”) will show the correct maps for that country/region. By default, the View parameter is set
     *     to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in the request. It is your responsibility to determine the
     *     location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have
     *     the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP address of the request. The
     *     View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those regarding
     *     mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to
     *     access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.
     *     <p>Please refer to [Supported Views](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsLocalizationViews) for details and to see the
     *     available Views.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ErrorResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.
     * @return the response.
