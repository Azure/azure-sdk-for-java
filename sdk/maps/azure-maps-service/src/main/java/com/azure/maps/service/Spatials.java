     * **Search Geofence Get API**
     *
     * <p>**Applies to:** S1 Pricing tier.
     *
     * <p>The Geofence Get API allows you to retrieve the proximity of a coordinate to a geofence that has been uploaded
     * to the Data service. You can use the [Data Upload
     * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) to upload a geofence or set of fences.
     * See [Geofencing GeoJSON data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/geofence-geojson) for more
     * details on the geofence data format. To query the proximity of a coordinate, you supply the location of the
     * object you are tracking as well as the ID for the fence or set of fences, and the response will contain
     * information about the distance from the outer edge of the geofence. A negative value signifies that the
     * coordinate is inside of the fence while a positive value means that it is outside of the
     * fence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This API can be used for a variety of scenarios that include things like asset
     * tracking, fleet management, or setting up alerts for moving objects.
     *
     * <p>The API supports [integration with Event
     * Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/azure-maps-event-grid-integration). The isAsync parameter is
     * used to enable integration with Event Grid (disabled by default). To test this API, you can upload the sample
     * data from Post Geofence API examples(Request Body) via Data Upload API and replace the [udid] from the sample
     * request below with the udid returned by Data Upload API.
     *
     * <p>### Geofencing InnerError code
     *
     * <p>In geofencing response error contract, `innererror` is an object containing service specific information about
     * the error. `code` is a property in `innererror` which can map to a specific geofencing error type. The table

     * format. The response will contain information about the distance from the outer edge of the geofence. A negative
     * value signifies that the coordinate is inside of the fence while a positive value means that it is outside of the
