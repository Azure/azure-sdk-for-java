     *
     * <p>The Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of routes defined by
     * origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) or synchronous (sync) POST request. For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     *
     * <p>For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     *
     * <p>The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     *
     * <p>### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum
     * size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100, you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of
     * a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that
     * constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     *
     * <p>``` POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key} ```
     *
     * <p>### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of
     * relatively complex routing requests. When you make a request by using async request, by default the service
     * returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
     * checked periodically until the response data or error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in
     * the request is set to true, user will get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     *
     * <p>The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     *
     * <p>The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after
     * the expiration period.
     *
     * <p>``` POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     *
     * <p>Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations: 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure
     * Maps
     *
     * <p>2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     *
     * <p>3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL
     * to download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     *
     * <p>``` GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key} ```
     *
     * <p>4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     *
     * <p>### Download Sync Results When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200
     * response code for successful request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will
     * be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     *
     * <p>### Download Async Results When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed
     * using our async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location
     * header of the response. This status URI looks like the following: ``` GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key} ```
     *
     * <p>The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.

     * response code for successful request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will
     * be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     *
     * <p>### Download Async Results When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed
     * using our async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location
     * header of the response. This status URI looks like the following: ``` GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key} ```
     *
     * <p>The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.

Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     *   - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     *     (or very near) the input reference route.
     *     - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     *     - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     *       of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     *       vehicle position on the reference route).
     *   - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     *     Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     *     Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     *     point will be excluded from the Response.
     *   - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     *     how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference

     * **Route Directions Batch API**
     *
     * <p>**Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
     *
     * <p>The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
     * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using just a single API call. You can
     * call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. ### Submit Asynchronous Batch
     * Request The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests - It
     * allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible). - The asynchronous API is
     * optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout. - The number of batch items is limited to
     * **700** for this API.
     *
     * <p>When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available. The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The
     * redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the expiration period.
     *
     * <p>Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical sequence of
     * operations: 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps 2. The server will respond with
     * one of the following:
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request`
     * or any other `Error` status code.
     *
     * <p>3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request. This status URI looks like following:
     *
     * <p>``` GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0 ``` Note:- Please
     * remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth - See [Security](#security)) to the _status URI_
     * before running it. &lt;br&gt; 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to
     * download the batch results.
     *
     * <p>### POST Body for Batch Request To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the
     * request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to
     * `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     *
     * <p>```json { "batchItems": [ { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * }, { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest"
     * }, { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" } ] } ```
     *
     * <p>A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
     * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     *
     * <p>The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     *
     * <p>### Download Asynchronous Batch Results To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to
     * the batch download endpoint. This _download URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful
     * `POST` batch request and looks like the following:
     *
     * <p>```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ``` Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results: 1. Client sends a `GET` request
     * using the _download URL_. 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     *
     * <p>### Batch Response Model The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading
     * the results of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch
     * response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of
     * the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch
     * response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch
     * request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the
     * batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in
     * `batchItems` is of one of the following types:
     *
     * <p>- [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     *
     * <p>- `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     *
     * <p>```json { "summary": { "successfulRequests": 1, "totalRequests": 2 }, "batchItems": [ { "statusCode": 200,

     * <p>### Download Asynchronous Batch Results To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to
     * the batch download endpoint. This _download URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful
     * `POST` batch request and looks like the following:
     *
     * <p>```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ``` Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results: 1. Client sends a `GET` request
     * using the _download URL_. 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     *
     * <p>&gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     *
     * <p>### Batch Response Model The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading
     * the results of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch
     * response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of
     * the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch
     * response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch
     * request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the
     * batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in
     * `batchItems` is of one of the following types:
     *
     * <p>- [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     *
     * <p>- `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     *
     * <p>```json { "summary": { "successfulRequests": 1, "totalRequests": 2 }, "batchItems": [ { "statusCode": 200,

    /**
     * **Route Directions Batch API**
     *
     * <p>**Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
     *
     * <p>The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
     * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using just a single API call. You can
     * call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API
     * allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. ### Submit Synchronous Batch
     * Request The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request,
     * it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the
     * results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than
     * 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API. ``` POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ``` ### Batch Response Model The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading
     * the results of an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch
     * response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of
     * the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch
     * response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch
     * request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the
     * batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in
     * `batchItems` is of one of the following types:
     *
     * <p>- [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If
     * the query completed successfully.
     *
     * <p>- `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *
     * <p>Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     *
     * <p>```json { "summary": { "successfulRequests": 1, "totalRequests": 2 }, "batchItems": [ { "statusCode": 200,
