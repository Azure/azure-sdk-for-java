     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using an asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of

     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).

     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.

     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone

     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     *

    /**
     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using an asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws HttpResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.

     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using an asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.

    /**
     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using an asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads

    /**
     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using an asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is

     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can

     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using an asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for
     * a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) request. To make a
     * synchronous (sync) request, see [Post Route Matrix Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix-sync). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     *

     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.

     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00

     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.

     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `GET` request that computes the travel time and distance for all possible
     * pairs in a list of origins and destinations. Unlike the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API, which provide detailed route instructions, this API
     * focuses on efficiency by giving you the cost (travel time and distance) of routing from each origin to every
     * destination. For more information, see [Best practices for Azure Maps Route
     * service](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-best-practices-for-routing).
     * 
     * For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination.
     * The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and
     * each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an
     * example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the
     * delivery from the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix GET request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a GET request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param matrixId Matrix id received after the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully.

     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `GET` request that computes the travel time and distance for all possible
     * pairs in a list of origins and destinations. Unlike the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API, which provide detailed route instructions, this API
     * focuses on efficiency by giving you the cost (travel time and distance) of routing from each origin to every
     * destination. For more information, see [Best practices for Azure Maps Route
     * service](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-best-practices-for-routing).
     * 
     * For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination.
     * The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and
     * each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an
     * example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the
     * delivery from the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix GET request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a GET request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.

     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix GET request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a GET request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.

     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Matrix` API is an HTTP `GET` request that computes the travel time and distance for all possible
     * pairs in a list of origins and destinations. Unlike the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API, which provide detailed route instructions, this API
     * focuses on efficiency by giving you the cost (travel time and distance) of routing from each origin to every
     * destination. For more information, see [Best practices for Azure Maps Route
     * service](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-best-practices-for-routing).

     *

     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix

     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.

     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.

     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.

     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used

     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of

     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     *

     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     *

     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone

     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix Sync` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries
     * for a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using a single synchronous (sync) request. To
     * make an asynchronous (async) request, see [Post Route Matrix](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     *

     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using a synchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix Sync` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries
     * for a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using a single synchronous (sync) request. To
     * make an asynchronous (async) request, see [Post Route Matrix](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.

     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws ErrorResponseException thrown if the request is rejected by server.

    /**
     * Use to get a route matrix showing the travel time and distance for all possible pairs in a list of origins and
     * destinations, using a synchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Matrix Sync` API is an HTTP `POST` request that allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries
     * for a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using a single synchronous (sync) request. To
     * make an asynchronous (async) request, see [Post Route Matrix](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-matrix). For every
     * given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
     * origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in
     * the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's
     * say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from
     * the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
     * 
     * 
     * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which
     * detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
     * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100,
     * you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of
     * origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix
     * dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you
     * make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in
     * the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or
     * error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200
     * response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.
     * 
     * 
     * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of
     * destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25.
     * 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
     * 
     * 
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ```
     * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
     * 
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Route Matrix request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad
     * Request or any other Error status code.
     * 
     * 
     * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
     * 
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
     * 
     * ### Download Sync Results
     * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful
     * request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to
     * retrieve the results later.
     * 
     * ### Download Async Results
     * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You
     * will be given a URL to check the progress of your async request in the location header of the response. This
     * status URI looks like the following:
     * ```
     * GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 
     * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
     * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route distance, travel
     * time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters. The minimum and the maximum
     * cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync respectively. For example, it can be 35
     * origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25 destinations for async API.
     * @param waitForResults Boolean to indicate whether to execute the request synchronously. If set to true, user will
     * get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds. Otherwise, user will get a 202 response right
     * away. Please refer to the API description for more details on 202 response. **Supported only for async request**.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with

     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently

     * passing through waypoints if specified. The route takes into account factors such as current traffic and the
     * typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific consumption model.
     * For more information, see [Consumption Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated

     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_

     * @param constantSpeedConsumptionInLitersPerHundredKm Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.
     * 
     * Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed &amp; consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a
     * consumption curve. Consumption rates for speeds not in the list are found as follows:
     * 
     * * by linear interpolation, if the given speed lies in between two speeds in the list
     * 
     * * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two
     * points in the list
     * 
     * The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not contain duplicate points for the same
     * speed. If it only contains a single point, then the consumption rate of that point is used without further
     * processing.
     * 
     * Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the penultimate largest
     * speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative consumption rates.
     * 
     * Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to a negative
     * consumption rate for any smaller speed.
     * 
     * The valid range for the consumption values(expressed in l/100km) is between 0.01 and 100000.0.
     *

     * Use to calculate a route between a specified origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Directions` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a route between an origin and a destination,
     * passing through waypoints if specified. The route takes into account factors such as current traffic and the
     * typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific consumption model.
     * For more information, see [Consumption Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. Proper nouns (the names
     * of streets, plazas, etc.) are returned in the specified language, or if that is not available, they are returned
     * in an available language that is close to it. Allowed values are (a subset of) the IETF language tags. The
     * currently supported languages are listed in the [Supported languages
     * section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages).
     * 
     * Default value: en-GB.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.

     * Use to calculate a route between a specified origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Directions` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a route between an origin and a destination,
     * passing through waypoints if specified. The route takes into account factors such as current traffic and the
     * typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific consumption model.
     * For more information, see [Consumption Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. Proper nouns (the names
     * of streets, plazas, etc.) are returned in the specified language, or if that is not available, they are returned
     * in an available language that is close to it. Allowed values are (a subset of) the IETF language tags. The
     * currently supported languages are listed in the [Supported languages
     * section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages).
     * 
     * Default value: en-GB.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param vehicleEngineType Engine type of the vehicle. When a detailed Consumption Model is specified, it must be
     * consistent with the value of **vehicleEngineType**.
     * @param constantSpeedConsumptionInLitersPerHundredKm Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.
     * 
     * Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed &amp; consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a
     * consumption curve. Consumption rates for speeds not in the list are found as follows:
     * 
     * * by linear interpolation, if the given speed lies in between two speeds in the list
     * 
     * * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two
     * points in the list
     * 
     * The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not contain duplicate points for the same

     * processing.
     * 
     * Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the penultimate largest
     * speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative consumption rates.
     * 
     * Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to a negative

     * Use to calculate a route between a specified origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Directions` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a route between an origin and a destination,
     * passing through waypoints if specified. The route takes into account factors such as current traffic and the
     * typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific consumption model.
     * For more information, see [Consumption Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. Proper nouns (the names
     * of streets, plazas, etc.) are returned in the specified language, or if that is not available, they are returned
     * in an available language that is close to it. Allowed values are (a subset of) the IETF language tags. The
     * currently supported languages are listed in the [Supported languages
     * section](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/supported-languages).
     * 
     * Default value: en-GB.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param vehicleEngineType Engine type of the vehicle. When a detailed Consumption Model is specified, it must be
     * consistent with the value of **vehicleEngineType**.
     * @param constantSpeedConsumptionInLitersPerHundredKm Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.
     * 
     * Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed &amp; consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a

     * Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the penultimate largest
     * speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative consumption rates.

     * Default value: en-GB.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and

     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.

     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing

     * Use to calculate a route between a specified origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Directions` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a route between an origin and a destination,
     * passing through waypoints if specified. The route takes into account factors such as current traffic and the
     * typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific consumption model.
     * For more information, see [Consumption Model](/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model).
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. Proper nouns (the names
     * of streets, plazas, etc.) are returned in the specified language, or if that is not available, they are returned
     * in an available language that is close to it. Allowed values are (a subset of) the IETF language tags. The

     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in

     * Use to calculate a route between a given origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns a route between an origin and a
     * destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as
     * current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific Consumption Model.
     * Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed
     * explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param routeDirectionParameters Used for reconstructing a route and for calculating zero or more alternative
     * routes to this reference route. The provided sequence of coordinates is used as input for route reconstruction.
     * The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path
     * parameter locations. If both minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime are set to zero, then these origin and
     * destination points are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route,
     * respectively. Intermediate locations (waypoints) are not supported when using supportingPoints.
     * 
     * Setting at least one of minDeviationDistance or minDeviationTime to a value greater than zero has the following
     * consequences:
     * 
     * * The origin point of the calculateRoute request must be on (or very near) the input reference route. If this is
     * not the case, an error is returned. However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning of the input
     * reference route (it can be thought of as the current vehicle position on the reference route).
     * * The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute response, will start at the origin point
     * specified in the calculateRoute request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin point
     * will be excluded from the response.
     * * The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how far alternative routes will be guaranteed
     * to follow the reference route from the origin point onwards.
     * * The route must use departAt.
     * * The vehicleHeading is ignored.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. It does not affect
     * proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) It has no effect when instructionsType=coded. Allowed values
     * are (a subset of) the IETF language tags described.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with

     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.

     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,

     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use

     * 
     * Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed &amp; consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a

     * 
     * * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two

     * 
     * The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not contain duplicate points for the same

     * processing.
     * 
     * Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the penultimate largest
     * speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative consumption rates.

     * Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to a negative
     * consumption rate for any smaller speed.
     * 
     * The valid range for the consumption values(expressed in l/100km) is between 0.01 and 100000.0.

     * Use to calculate a route between a given origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns a route between an origin and a
     * destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as
     * current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific Consumption Model.
     * Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed
     * explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param routeDirectionParameters Used for reconstructing a route and for calculating zero or more alternative
     * routes to this reference route. The provided sequence of coordinates is used as input for route reconstruction.
     * The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path
     * parameter locations. If both minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime are set to zero, then these origin and
     * destination points are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route,
     * respectively. Intermediate locations (waypoints) are not supported when using supportingPoints.
     * 
     * Setting at least one of minDeviationDistance or minDeviationTime to a value greater than zero has the following
     * consequences:
     * 
     * * The origin point of the calculateRoute request must be on (or very near) the input reference route. If this is
     * not the case, an error is returned. However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning of the input
     * reference route (it can be thought of as the current vehicle position on the reference route).
     * * The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute response, will start at the origin point
     * specified in the calculateRoute request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin point
     * will be excluded from the response.
     * * The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how far alternative routes will be guaranteed
     * to follow the reference route from the origin point onwards.
     * * The route must use departAt.
     * * The vehicleHeading is ignored.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. It does not affect
     * proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) It has no effect when instructionsType=coded. Allowed values
     * are (a subset of) the IETF language tags described.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,

     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use

     * Use to calculate a route between a given origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns a route between an origin and a
     * destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as
     * current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific Consumption Model.
     * Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed
     * explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param routeDirectionParameters Used for reconstructing a route and for calculating zero or more alternative
     * routes to this reference route. The provided sequence of coordinates is used as input for route reconstruction.
     * The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path
     * parameter locations. If both minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime are set to zero, then these origin and
     * destination points are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route,
     * respectively. Intermediate locations (waypoints) are not supported when using supportingPoints.
     * 
     * Setting at least one of minDeviationDistance or minDeviationTime to a value greater than zero has the following
     * consequences:
     * 
     * * The origin point of the calculateRoute request must be on (or very near) the input reference route. If this is
     * not the case, an error is returned. However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning of the input
     * reference route (it can be thought of as the current vehicle position on the reference route).
     * * The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute response, will start at the origin point
     * specified in the calculateRoute request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin point
     * will be excluded from the response.
     * * The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how far alternative routes will be guaranteed
     * to follow the reference route from the origin point onwards.
     * * The route must use departAt.
     * * The vehicleHeading is ignored.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. It does not affect
     * proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) It has no effect when instructionsType=coded. Allowed values
     * are (a subset of) the IETF language tags described.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param vehicleEngineType Engine type of the vehicle. When a detailed Consumption Model is specified, it must be
     * consistent with the value of **vehicleEngineType**.
     * @param constantSpeedConsumptionInLitersPerHundredKm Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.
     * 
     * Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed &amp; consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a
     * consumption curve. Consumption rates for speeds not in the list are found as follows:
     * 
     * * by linear interpolation, if the given speed lies in between two speeds in the list
     * 
     * * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two
     * points in the list
     * 
     * The list must contain between 1 and 25 points (inclusive), and may not contain duplicate points for the same

     * Consumption specified for the largest speed must be greater than or equal to that of the penultimate largest
     * speed. This ensures that extrapolation does not lead to negative consumption rates.
     * 
     * Similarly, consumption values specified for the two smallest speeds in the list cannot lead to a negative

     * Use to calculate a route between a given origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns a route between an origin and a
     * destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as
     * current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific Consumption Model.
     * Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed
     * explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param routeDirectionParameters Used for reconstructing a route and for calculating zero or more alternative
     * routes to this reference route. The provided sequence of coordinates is used as input for route reconstruction.
     * The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path
     * parameter locations. If both minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime are set to zero, then these origin and
     * destination points are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route,
     * respectively. Intermediate locations (waypoints) are not supported when using supportingPoints.
     * 
     * Setting at least one of minDeviationDistance or minDeviationTime to a value greater than zero has the following
     * consequences:
     * 
     * * The origin point of the calculateRoute request must be on (or very near) the input reference route. If this is
     * not the case, an error is returned. However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning of the input
     * reference route (it can be thought of as the current vehicle position on the reference route).
     * * The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute response, will start at the origin point
     * specified in the calculateRoute request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin point
     * will be excluded from the response.
     * * The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how far alternative routes will be guaranteed
     * to follow the reference route from the origin point onwards.
     * * The route must use departAt.
     * * The vehicleHeading is ignored.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. It does not affect
     * proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) It has no effect when instructionsType=coded. Allowed values
     * are (a subset of) the IETF language tags described.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.
     * @param computeTravelTime Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic
     * information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
     * @param vehicleHeading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees starting at true North and continuing in
     * clockwise direction. North is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, west is 270 degrees. Possible
     * values 0-359.
     * @param report Specifies which data should be reported for diagnosis purposes. The only possible value is
     * _effectiveSettings_. Reports the effective parameters or data used when calling the API. In the case of defaulted
     * parameters the default will be reflected where the parameter was not specified by the caller.
     * @param filterSectionType Specifies which of the section types is reported in the route response.
     * &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example if sectionType = pedestrian the sections which are suited for pedestrians only
     * are returned. Can be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;sectionType=carTrain&amp;sectionType=pedestrian&amp;sectionType=motorway'. The default sectionType refers
     * to the travelMode input. By default travelMode is set to car.
     * @param arriveAt The date and time of arrival at the destination point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified it will be assumed to be that of the destination point.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `arriveAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `departAt`, `minDeviationDistance` or
     * `minDeviationTime`.
     * @param departAt The date and time of departure from the origin point formatted as a `dateTime` value as defined
     * in [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6), with an optional time zone
     * offset. When a time zone offset is not specified, it will be assumed to be that of the origin point.
     * * Default value: now
     * * Other value: `dateTime`
     * 
     * Examples:
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57
     * * 2023-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
     * 
     * The `departAt` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with `arriveAt`.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.
     * 
     * * In all other cases, this parameter is ignored.
     * 
     * Sensible Values : for **Combustion Model** : 1600, for **Electric Model** : 1900.
     * @param isCommercialVehicle Whether the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. Commercial vehicles may not be
     * allowed to drive on some roads.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param routeType The type of route requested.
     * @param vehicleLoadType Types of cargo that may be classified as hazardous materials and restricted from some
     * roads. Available vehicleLoadType values are US Hazmat classes 1 through 9, plus generic classifications for use
     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param vehicleEngineType Engine type of the vehicle. When a detailed Consumption Model is specified, it must be
     * consistent with the value of **vehicleEngineType**.
     * @param constantSpeedConsumptionInLitersPerHundredKm Specifies the speed-dependent component of consumption.
     * 
     * Provided as an unordered list of colon-delimited speed &amp; consumption-rate pairs. The list defines points on a

     * 
     * * by linear extrapolation otherwise, assuming a constant (ΔConsumption/ΔSpeed) determined by the nearest two
     * points in the list
     *

     * * The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute response, will start at the origin point
     * specified in the calculateRoute request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin point
     * will be excluded from the response.
     * * The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how far alternative routes will be guaranteed
     * to follow the reference route from the origin point onwards.
     * * The route must use departAt.

     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in

     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not

     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight

     * Use to calculate a route between a given origin and destination, passing through any specified waypoints.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions` API is an HTTP `POST` request that returns a route between an origin and a
     * destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as
     * current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.
     * 
     * Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry.
     * Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available,
     * depending on the options selected.
     * 
     * Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific Consumption Model.
     * Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed
     * explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.
     * 
     * @param format Desired format of the response. Value can be either _json_ or _xml_.
     * @param routePoints The Coordinates through which the route is calculated, delimited by a colon. A minimum of two
     * coordinates is required. The first one is the origin and the last is the destination of the route. Optional
     * coordinates in-between act as WayPoints in the route. You can pass up to 150 WayPoints.
     * @param routeDirectionParameters Used for reconstructing a route and for calculating zero or more alternative
     * routes to this reference route. The provided sequence of coordinates is used as input for route reconstruction.
     * The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path
     * parameter locations. If both minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime are set to zero, then these origin and
     * destination points are expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route,
     * respectively. Intermediate locations (waypoints) are not supported when using supportingPoints.
     * 
     * Setting at least one of minDeviationDistance or minDeviationTime to a value greater than zero has the following
     * consequences:
     * 
     * * The origin point of the calculateRoute request must be on (or very near) the input reference route. If this is
     * not the case, an error is returned. However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning of the input
     * reference route (it can be thought of as the current vehicle position on the reference route).
     * * The reference route, returned as the first route in the calculateRoute response, will start at the origin point
     * specified in the calculateRoute request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin point
     * will be excluded from the response.
     * * The values of minDeviationDistance and minDeviationTime determine how far alternative routes will be guaranteed
     * to follow the reference route from the origin point onwards.
     * * The route must use departAt.
     * * The vehicleHeading is ignored.
     * @param maxAlternatives Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated. Default: 0, minimum: 0 and maximum:
     * 5.
     * @param alternativeType Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated
     * alternatives compared to the reference route.
     * @param minDeviationDistance All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * @param minDeviationTime All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST
     * Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be
     * used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt.
     * Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
     * - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
     * (or very near) the input reference route.
     * - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
     * - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
     * of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
     * vehicle position on the reference route).
     * - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
     * Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
     * Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
     * point will be excluded from the Response.
     * - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
     * how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
     * route from the origin point onwards.
     * - The route must use _departAt_.
     * - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.
     * @param instructionsType If specified, guidance instructions will be returned. Note that the instructionsType
     * parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none.
     * @param language The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. It does not affect
     * proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) It has no effect when instructionsType=coded. Allowed values
     * are (a subset of) the IETF language tags described.
     * @param computeBestWaypointOrder Re-order the route waypoints using a fast heuristic algorithm to reduce the route
     * length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType _shortest_. Notice that origin and
     * destination are excluded from the optimized waypoint indices. To include origin and destination in the response,
     * please increase all the indices by 1 to account for the origin, and then add the destination as the final index.
     * Possible values are true or false. True computes a better order if possible, but is not allowed to be used in
     * conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. False will use the
     * locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation _none_.
     * @param routeRepresentationForBestOrder Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response.
     * This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder=true.

     * @param useTrafficData Possible values:
     * * true - Do consider all available traffic information during routing
     * * false - Ignore current traffic data during routing. Note that although the current traffic data is ignored
     * during routing, the effect of historic traffic on effective road speeds is still incorporated.
     * @param avoid Specifies something that the route calculation should try to avoid when determining the route. Can
     * be specified multiple times in one request, for example,
     * '&amp;avoid=motorways&amp;avoid=tollRoads&amp;avoid=ferries'. In Route Range requests, the value alreadyUsedRoads
     * must not be used.
     * @param travelMode The mode of travel for the requested route. If not defined, default is 'car'. Note that the
     * requested travelMode may not be available for the entire route. Where the requested travelMode is not available
     * for a particular section, the travelMode element of the response for that section will be "other". Note that
     * travel modes bus, motorcycle, taxi and van are BETA functionality. Full restriction data is not available in all
     * areas.
     * @param inclineLevel Degree of hilliness for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param windingness Level of turns for thrilling route. This parameter can only be used in conjunction with
     * `routeType`=thrilling.
     * @param vehicleAxleWeight Weight per axle of the vehicle in kg. A value of 0 means that weight restrictions per
     * axle are not considered.
     * @param vehicleWidth Width of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that width restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleHeight Height of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that height restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleLength Length of the vehicle in meters. A value of 0 means that length restrictions are not
     * considered.
     * @param vehicleMaxSpeed Maximum speed of the vehicle in km/hour. The max speed in the vehicle profile is used to
     * check whether a vehicle is allowed on motorways.
     * 
     * * A value of 0 means that an appropriate value for the vehicle will be determined and applied during route
     * planning.
     * 
     * * A non-zero value may be overridden during route planning. For example, the current traffic flow is 60 km/hour.
     * If the vehicle maximum speed is set to 50 km/hour, the routing engine will consider 60 km/hour as this is the
     * current situation. If the maximum speed of the vehicle is provided as 80 km/hour but the current traffic flow is
     * 60 km/hour, then routing engine will again use 60 km/hour.
     * @param vehicleWeight Weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
     * 
     * * It is mandatory if any of the *Efficiency parameters are set.
     * 
     * * It must be strictly positive when used in the context of the Consumption Model. Weight restrictions are
     * considered.
     * 
     * * If no detailed **Consumption Model** is specified and the value of **vehicleWeight** is non-zero, then weight
     * restrictions are considered.

     * in other countries/regions. Values beginning with USHazmat are for US routing while otherHazmat should be used
     * for all other countries/regions. vehicleLoadType can be specified multiple times. This parameter is currently
     * only considered for travelMode=truck.
     * @param vehicleEngineType Engine type of the vehicle. When a detailed Consumption Model is specified, it must be

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Get Route Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API in a
     * single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single asynchronous request. You can call
     * `Route Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. To call the `Post Route Directions
     * Batch` API in a synchronous request, see [Post Route Directions Batch
     * Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch-sync).
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 1,
     * "totalRequests": 2

     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 1,
     * "totalRequests": 2

     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     *

     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Get Route Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API in a
     * single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single asynchronous request. You can call
     * `Route Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. To call the `Post Route Directions
     * Batch` API in a synchronous request, see [Post Route Directions Batch
     * Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch-sync).
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Get Route Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API in a
     * single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single asynchronous request. You can call
     * `Route Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. To call the `Post Route Directions
     * Batch` API in a synchronous request, see [Post Route Directions Batch
     * Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch-sync).
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 1,
     * "totalRequests": 2

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Get Route Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API in a
     * single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single asynchronous request. You can call
     * `Route Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. To call the `Post Route Directions
     * Batch` API in a synchronous request, see [Post Route Directions Batch
     * Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch-sync).
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 1,
     * "totalRequests": 2
     * },

     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values
     * in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be escaped with \\ ) and it
     * should also be properly URL-encoded.
     * 
     * 
     * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and the batch
     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "summary": {
     * "successfulRequests": 1,
     * "totalRequests": 2

    /**
     * Use to send a batch of queries to the [Get Route Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API in a
     * single asynchronous request.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Post Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `POST` request that sends batches of queries to the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single asynchronous request. You can call
     * `Route Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. To call the `Post Route Directions
     * Batch` API in a synchronous request, see [Post Route Directions Batch
     * Sync](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch-sync).
     * 
     * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
     * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
     * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
     * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
     * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
     * 
     * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a
     * redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the
     * response data or error information is available.
     * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the
     * expiration period.
     * 
     * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running operation. Here's a typical sequence of operations:
     * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400 Bad Request` or
     * any other `Error` status code.
     * 
     * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains the URL to
     * download the results of the batch request.
     * This status URI looks like following:
     * ```
     * GET
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch results.
     * 
     * ### POST Body for Batch Request
     * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the
     * `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a
     * sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
     * 
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     * "batchItems": [
     * { "query":
     * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&amp;travelMode=bicycle&amp;routeType=eco&amp;traffic=false"
     * },
     * { "query": "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&amp;travelMode=pedestrian&amp;routeType=shortest" },
     * { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
     * ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path, api-version
     * and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
     * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The string values

     * should contain at least **1** query.
     * 
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}

     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The `Get Route Directions Batch` API is an HTTP `GET` request that sends batches of queries to the [Get Route
     * Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single request. You can call `Get Route
     * Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows caller
     * to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries.
     * 
     * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
     * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint. This _download
     * URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request and looks like the
     * following:
     * 
     * ```
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
     * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
     * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some
     * time.
     * 
     * &gt; HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch results.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     *

     * Route Directions](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-directions) API using a single synchronous request. You can call
     * `Route Directions Batch` API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously (sync). The async API allows
     * caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries. To call the `Post Route Directions
     * Batch` API in a asynchronous request, see [Post Route Directions
     * Batch](/rest/api/maps/route/post-route-directions-batch).
     * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
     * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will
     * respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.
     * The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The
     * number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
     * ```
     * POST
     * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/sync/json?api-version=1.0&amp;subscription-key={subscription-key}
     * ```
     * ### Batch Response Model
     * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an async batch
     * request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch response. This batch response
     * contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request
     * and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a
     * `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will
     * contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in
     * `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the
     * following types:
     * 
     * - [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections) - If the
     * query completed successfully.
     * 
     * - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
     * 
     * 
     * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
     *
