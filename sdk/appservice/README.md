# Azure App Service libraries for Java

Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises. App Service includes the web and mobile capabilities that were previously delivered separately as Azure Websites and Azure Mobile Services.

This library supports managing Azure App Service resources, including:

- Web Apps and Function Apps
- App Service Plans
- App Service Environments
- Certificates and Custom Domains
- Deployment Slots

The library is built on top of [azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md) and follows the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).
