# Azure Identity client library for Java

The Azure Identity V2 library provides [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis) ([formerly Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) token authentication support across the Azure SDK.

## Getting started

### Include the package

#### Include the BOM file

#### Include direct dependency

To take dependency on a particular version of the library that isn't present in the BOM, add the direct dependency to your project as follows:

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-identity-v2;dependency})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-identity-v2</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-beta.1</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})
