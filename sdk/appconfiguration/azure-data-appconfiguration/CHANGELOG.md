## Version 1.0.0-preview.2 (2019-08-06)
For details on the Azure SDK for Java (August 2019 Preview) release refer to the [release announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview2-java).

- Merged ConfigurationClientBuilder and ConfigurationAsyncClientBuilder into ConfigurationClientBuilder. Method to build each client were added.
- ConfigurationClientBuilder was made instantiable, static builder method removed from ConfigurationClient and ConfigurationAsyncClient.
- Builder method credentials renamed to credential and serviceEndpoint to endpoint.
- Listing operations return PagedFlux and PagedIterable in their respective clients.
- Asynchronous calls check subscriberContext for tracing context.
- Synchronous calls support passing tracing context in maximal overloads.

**Breaking changes: New API Design**
- Simplified API to return model types directly on non-maximal overloads. Maximal overloads return `Response<T>` and suffixed with WithResponse.

## Version 1.0.0-preview.1 (2019-06-28)
Version 1.0.0-preview.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic 
to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide 
our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).
