# Azure Metrics Advisor client library samples for Java
TODO
Azure Metrics Advisor samples are a set of self-contained Java programs that demonstrate interacting with Azure Metrics Advisor service
using the client library. Each sample focuses on a specific scenario and can be executed independently. 

## Key concepts
Key concepts are explained in detail [here][SDK_README_KEY_CONCEPTS].

## Getting started
Getting started explained in detail [here][SDK_README_GETTING_STARTED].

## Examples
TODO
The following sections provide code samples covering common scenario operations with the Azure Metrics Advisor client library.

All of these samples need the endpoint to your Metrics Advisor resource ([instructions on how to get endpoint][get-endpoint-instructions]), and your Metrics Advisor API key ([instructions on how to get key][get-key-instructions]).
