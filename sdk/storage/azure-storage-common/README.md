# Azure Storage Common shared library for Java
Azure Storage Common is a library that has common dependencies for all Azure Storage packages.

[Source code][source] | [API reference documentation][docs]

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Create Storage Account][storage_account]

### Include the package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-storage-common;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-storage-common</artifactId>
    <version>12.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## Key concepts


## Examples


## Troubleshooting

### Default HTTP Client
All client libraries by default use the Netty HTTP client. Adding the above dependency will automatically configure
the client library to use the Netty HTTP client. Configuring or changing the HTTP client is detailed in the
[HTTP clients wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/HTTP-clients).

### Default SSL library
All client libraries, by default, use the Tomcat-native Boring SSL library to enable native-level performance for SSL
operations. The Boring SSL library is an uber jar containing native libraries for Linux / macOS / Windows, and provides
better performance compared to the default SSL implementation within the JDK. For more information, including how to
reduce the dependency size, refer to the [performance tuning][performance_tuning] section of the wiki.
