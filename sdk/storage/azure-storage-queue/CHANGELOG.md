### Support for binary data, custom shapes and Base64 encoding
This release adds a convenient way to send and receive binary data and custom shapes as a payload.
Additionally, support for Base64 encoding in HTTP requests and responses has been added that makes interoperability with V11 and prior Storage SDK easier to implement.

The `QueueClient.sendMessage` and `QueueAsyncClient.sendMessage` consume `com.azure.core.util.BinaryData` in addition to `String`.
`QueueMessageItem` and `PeekedMessageItem` expose new property `getBody()` of `com.azure.core.util.BinaryData` type to access message payload and should be used instead of `getMessageText()`.

See [BinaryData](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.core.util.binarydata?view=azure-java-stable) for more information about handling `String`, binary data and custom shapes.

#### Receiving message as string
Before:
```java
QueueMessageItem message = queueClient.receiveMessage();
String messageText = message.getMessageText();
```

After:
```java
QueueMessageItem message = queueClient.receiveMessage();
BinaryData body = message.getBody();
String messageText = body.toString();
```
