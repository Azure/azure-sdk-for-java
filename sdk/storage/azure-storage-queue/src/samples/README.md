# Azure Storage Queue Samples client library for Java
This document explains samples and how to use them.

## Key concepts
More detail is defined at [queue key concept][queue_key_concept].

## Getting started
Getting started explained in detail [here][SDK_README_GETTING_STARTED].

For details on including this dependency in other build tools (Gradle, SBT, etc), refer [here](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-core).

## Examples

Get started with our samples:
- [QueueServiceSample][samples_queue_service]: Create, list and delete queues
- [MessageSample][samples_message]: Enqueue, peek dequeue, update, clear and delete messages. Get properties of the queue.
- [QueueExceptionSample][samples_queue_exception]: Handle the exceptions from storage queue service side.
- [AsyncSample][samples_async]: Create queue and enqueue message using async queue client call.

## Troubleshooting
When interacting with blobs using this Java client library, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP
status codes returned for [REST API][error_codes] requests. For example, if you try to retrieve a container or blob that
doesn't exist in your Storage Account, a `404` error is returned, indicating `Not Found`

## Next steps
Start using Storage Queue Java SDK in your solutions. Our SDK details could be found at [SDK README][SDK_README]. 

###  Additional Documentation
For more extensive documentation on Azure Storage blob, see the [API reference documentation][storage_queue_rest].
