# Azure Storage Blob Changefeed Samples client library for Java
This document explains samples and how to use them.

## Key concepts

Key concepts are explained in detail [here][SDK_README_KEY_CONCEPTS].

## Getting started
Getting started explained in detail [here][SDK_README_GETTING_STARTED].

## Examples
   Following section document various examples.

## Troubleshooting
When interacting with blobs using this Java client library, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP
status codes returned for [REST API][error_codes] requests. For example, if you try to retrieve a container or blob that
doesn't exist in your Storage Account, a `404` error is returned, indicating `Not Found`

## Next steps
Start using Storage blob changefeed Java SDK in your solutions. Our SDK details could be found at [SDK README][CHANGEFEED_SDK_README]. 

###  Additional Documentation
For more extensive documentation on Azure Storage blob, see the [API reference documentation][storageblob_rest].
