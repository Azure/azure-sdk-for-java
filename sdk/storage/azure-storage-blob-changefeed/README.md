# Azure Blob Storage change feed client library for Java

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob
storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data.
Unstructured data is data that does not adhere to a particular data model or
definition, such as text or binary data.
This package supports change feed for blob storage. 

TODO (gapra) : This is a placeholder. Add docs and point users to blob readme and add changefeed specific samples.
