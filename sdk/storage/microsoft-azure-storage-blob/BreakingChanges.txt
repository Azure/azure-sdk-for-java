2018.03.22 Version 11.0.0
* Upgraded to version 2.1.0 of the autorest-clientruntime which includes several important fixes to mitigate a commonly-seen "Connection reset by peer" error and other similar bugs.
* HTTPGetterInfo was made an internal type as it is an internal implementation detail.
* Added SourceModifiedAccessConditions parameter to StageBlockFromURL
* Removed DEFAULT and NONE static variables. Empty constructors should be used instead. DEFAULT static values were error prone and unsafe to use because although the field was final, the objects were mutable, so it was possible the value could be changed accidentally and alter the behavior of the program.
* Changed *ListingDetails to *ListDetails. These name changes are to mitigate conflicts with v8, allowing for side-by-side loading of different versions, which may help with upgrading.
* Removed the extra quotes around etags in some responses so they are consistently now consistently formatted.
* Moved the Generated*** types into the blob package to avoid conflicts with generated types from other services (i.e. queues and files)
* Changed the logger name to be the name of class that uses it, which is a more conventional practice
* Made the max results field on listing responses Integer instead of int as it is an optional field only returned when specified in the request.

2018.08.11 Version 10.1.0
* Interfaces for helper types updated to be more consistent throughout the library. All types, with the exception of the options for pipeline factories, use a fluent pattern.
* Removed RetryReader type as it's functionality was moved to be built into the DownloadResponse. RetryReaderOptions are now named ReliableDownloadOptions.
* Restructured the access conditions to be more logically adhere to their respective functions.
* Added support for context parameter on each api to allow communication with the pipeline from the application level
* Added an option to configure that maximum size data that will be uploaded in a single shot via the TransferManager.

2018.08.22 Version 10.0.4-rc
* Changed BlobURL.startCopy sourceAccessConditions parameter to be HTTPAccessConditions as lease is not actually supported.
* UploadFromFile now takes an AsynchronousFileChannel.
* UploadByteBuffersToBlockBlob, UploadByteBufferToBlockBlob, and DownloadToBuffer have been removed.
* IPRange fields are now strings.

2018.08.07 Version 10.0.2-Preview
* Changed BlobListingDetails constructor to take a flag to include deleted blobs.
* Restructured the blob and container listing responses.
* BlockBlobURL.MAX_PUT_BLOCK_BYTES renamed to BlockBlobURL.MAX_STAGE_BLOCK_BYTES.
* Changed the accessConditions parameter to be HTTPAccessConditions instead of BlobAccessConditions, since only http access conditions are supported.

2018.07.03 Version 10.0.1-Preview
* Created the StorageException type, which deserializes the XML payload in an error response if present and gives access to the ErrorCode header as a property.
* Changed the AppendBlobAccessConditions field types to be Long instead of Int.
* Changed RequestRetryOptions maxTries and tryTimeout fields to be Integer instead of int. 0 is no longer allowed.
* Changed the return type of BlobURL.download to be a DownloadResponse instead of BlobsDownloadResponse for integration with RetryReader.
* Changed CommonRestResponse.lastModifiedTime to be lastModified.
* Changed the dateProperty field in all auto-generated files to be date.
