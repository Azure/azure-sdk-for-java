/**
 * Package containing the data models for PersonalizerClientV1Preview3.
 * Personalizer Service is an Azure Cognitive Service that makes it easy to target content and experiences without
 * complex pre-analysis or cleanup of past data. Given a context and featurized content, the Personalizer Service
 * returns which content item to show to users in rewardActionId. As rewards are sent in response to the use of
 * rewardActionId, the reinforcement learning algorithm will improve the model and improve performance of future rank
 * calls.
