/**
 * Package containing classes for PersonalizerClientV1Preview3. Personalizer Service is an Azure Cognitive Service that
 * makes it easy to target content and experiences without complex pre-analysis or cleanup of past data. Given a context
 * and featurized content, the Personalizer Service returns which content item to show to users in rewardActionId. As
 * rewards are sent in response to the use of rewardActionId, the reinforcement learning algorithm will improve the
 * model and improve performance of future rank calls.
