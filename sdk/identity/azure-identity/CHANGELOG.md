# Release History

## 1.0.0-preview.1 (2019-06-28)
Version 1.0.0-preview.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating an authentication API for Azure SDK client libraries that is developer-friendly, idiomatic
to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide
our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azuresdkspecs.z5.web.core.windows.net/JavaSpec.html).

For details on the Azure SDK for Java (July 2019 Preview) release, you can refer to the [release announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-sdk-preview1-java).

This release supports service principal and managed identity authentication.
See the [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)
for more details. User authentication will be added in an upcoming preview
release.

This release supports only global Azure Active Directory tenants, i.e. those
using the https://login.microsoftonline.com authentication endpoint.
