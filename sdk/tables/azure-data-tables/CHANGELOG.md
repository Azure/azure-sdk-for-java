# Release History

## 12.0.0-beta.8 (Unreleased)

### New Features

- Introduced the `TableTransactionAction` class and the `TableTransactionActionType` enum.
- Added support for generating SAS tokens at the Account and Table Service level in all clients.
- Added the following methods to `TableClient`, `TableAsyncClient`:
    - `listAccessPolicies()`
    - `setAccessPolicies()`
    - `setAccessPoliciesWithResponse()`
    - `generateSasToken()`
- Added the following methods to `TableServiceClient`, `TableServiceAsyncClient`:
    - `getProperties()`
    - `getPropertiesWithResponse()`
    - `setProperties()`
    - `setPropertiesWithResponse()`
    - `getStatistics()`
    - `getStatisticsWithResponse()`
    - `generateAccountSasToken()`

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `TableBatch` and `TableAsyncBatch` types, as well as the methods `TableAsyncClient.createBatch()` and `TableClient.createBatch()`. In their place, batch operations can now be submitted via the following methods:
    - `TableAsyncClient.submitTransaction(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch)`
    - `TableAsyncClient.submitTransactionWithResponse(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch)`
    - `TableClient.submitTransaction(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch)`
    - `TableClient.submitTransactionWithResponse(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch, Duration timeout, Context context)`
- `deleteEntity()` variants in `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient` now accept an `ifUnchanged` flag instead of an `eTag` parameter for conditional operations. When said flag is set to `true`, the ETag of a given `TableEntity` will be matched with the ETag of the entity in the Table service.
- Replaced `deleteEntityWithResponse(String partitionKey, String rowKey, String eTag)` with `deleteEntityWithResponse(TableEntity entity, boolean ifUnchanged)` in `TableAsyncClient`.
- Replaced `deleteEntityWithResponse(String partitionKey, String rowKey, String eTag, Duration timeout, Context context)` with `deleteEntityWithResponse(TableEntity entity, boolean ifUnchanged, Duration timeout, Context context)` in `TableClient`.
- Removed remaining public APIs supporting the use of `TableEntity` subclasses from `TableAsyncClient`.
- Removed the following method overloads from `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`:
    - `upsertEntity(TableEntity entity, TableEntityUpdateMode updateMode)`
    - `updateEntity(TableEntity entity, TableEntityUpdateMode updateMode,
      boolean ifUnchanged)`
    - `getEntity(String partitionKey, String rowKey, List<String> select)`
- Client builders now also throw an `IllegalStateException` when calling `buildClient()` and `buildAsyncClient()` if multiple forms of authentication are provided, with the exception of `sasToken` + `connectionString`; or if `endpoint` and/or `sasToken` are set alongside a `connectionString` and the endpoint and/or SAS token in the latter are different than the former, respectively.

## 12.0.0-beta.7 (2021-05-15)

### New Features

- Added `getAccessPolicy()` and `setAccessPolicy()` to `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`.
- Added `getProperties()`, `setProperties()` and `getStatistics()` to `TableServiceClient` and `TableServiceAsyncClient`.
- Added the following models:
    - `TableAccessPolicy`
    - `TableServiceCorsRule`
    - `TableServiceGeoReplication`
    - `TableServiceGeoReplicationStatus`
    - `TableServiceLogging`
    - `TableServiceMetrics`
    - `TableServiceProperties`
    - `TableServiceRetentionPolicy`
    - `TableServiceStatistics`
    - `TableSignedIdentifier`

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `create()` and `delete()` methods to `createTable()` and `deleteTable()` on `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`. Also made `createTable()` and its variants return a `TableItem`.
- Removed `deleteEntity(String partitionKey, String rowKey, String eTag)` and added `deleteEntity(TableEntity tableEntity)` in both `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`.
- Made it so that when deleting a table or entity that does not exist, the resulting `404` error gets swallowed instead of thrown.
- Removed public APIs supporting the use of `TableEntity` subclasses.
- Made the following classes `final`:
    - `TableEntity`
    - `TableItem`
    - `TableClient`
    - `TableServiceClient`
    - `TableServiceAsyncClient`
    - `TableClientBuilder`
    - `TableServiceClientBuilder`.
- Removed method overloads that used `timeout`, except in the maximal overload for a method (the `withResponse` variant).
- Ensured that all timeout usages are client-side and not server-side.
- Made `createTable()` and `createTableIfNotExists()` in `TableServiceClient` and `TableServiceAsyncClient` return a `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient` respectively.
- Made select in `ListEntitiesOptions` a `List` of `Strings` instead of a single `String`. Did the same for select in `getEntity()` and `getEntityWithResponse()` in `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`.
- Replaced `retryOptions(RequestRetryOptions)` with `retryPolicy(RetryPolicy)` in `TableClientBuilder` and `TableServiceClientBuilder`.
- Removed `TableSharedKeyCredential` in favor of using Azure Core's `AzureNamedKeyCredential`.
- Replaced `TableSharedKeyCredentialPolicy` with `AzureNamedKeyCredentialPolicy`.
- Renamed `UpdateMode` to `TableEntityUpdateMode`.
- Renamed `TablesServiceVersion` to `TableServiceVersion`.
- Renamed `getTableUrl()` and `getApiVersion()` to `getTableEndpoint()` and `getServiceVersion()` respectively, in `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`.
- Renamed `getServiceUrl()` and `getApiVersion()` to `getServiceEndpoint()` and `getServiceVersion()` respectively, in `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`.
- Renamed `addProperties()` to `setProperties()` in `TableEntity`. Also made `setProperties()` replace the contents of properties map with those of the argument, instead of adding them to the existing properties.
- Removed dependency on `azure-storage-common` and added direct dependency on `azure-core-http-netty`.

### Bug Fixes

- Merge operations no longer fail for Cosmos table endpoints.
- Fixed issue with `TablesJacksonSerializer` where it could not handle HTTP responses with empty bodies.

### Dependency Updates
- Upgraded `azure-core` dependency to `1.16.0`.

## 12.0.0-beta.6 (2021-04-07)

### Breaking Changes

- All clients and batch classes now throw a public `TableServiceErrorException` instead of the one in the implementation package.
- All operation error details (`errorCode`, `languageCode`, `errorMessage`) are now contained in the public `TableServiceError`, as opposed to the implementation `TableServiceError` that contains a `TableServiceErrorOdataError` containing a `TableServiceErrorOdataErrorMessage`.
- `TableClientBuilder` fluent setters now throw an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `NullPointerException` when given invalid arguments.

### Dependency Updates
- Updated dependency version of `azure-core` to 1.15.0.
- Updated dependency version of `azure-storage-common` to 12.10.1.

## 12.0.0-beta.5 (2021-03-10)

### New Features

- Added support to specify whether or not a pipeline policy should be added per call or per retry.
- Added support for passing Azure Core's `ClientOptions` to client builders.

### Dependency Updates

- Updated dependency version of `azure-core` to 1.14.0.

## 12.0.0-beta.4 (2021-02-11)

### Dependency Updates

- Updated dependency version of `azure-core` to 1.13.0.
- Updated dependency version of `azure-storage-common` to 12.10.0.

## 12.0.0-beta.3 (2020-11-12)

### New Features

- Developers can now perform multiple insert, update, or delete entity operations as part of a transactional batch. For
  more information on transactional batching with Azure Tables, see
  [Performing entity group transactions](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/performing-entity-group-transactions).
  Performing query operations as part of a transactional batch is not currently supported.
  [#15091](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/15901)

### Key Bug Fixes

- The table client returned from a service client's `getTableClient(tableName)` method was incorrectly configured,
  causing operations to fail. [#16292](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/16292)
- Calling `getApiVersion()` on any client no longer causes an exception.
- Passing a `TokenCredential` to a client builder mistakenly assumed it was always a shared key credential.
- Client methods that accept a `timeout` and/or `context` parameter will use default values if either parameter is set
  to `null`. [#16386](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/16386)
- Methods that perform upsert entity operations were mistakenly performing update operations instead.

### Dependency Updates

- Updated dependency version of `azure-core` to 1.10.0.
- Updated dependency version of `azure-storage-common` to 12.9.0.

## 12.0.0-beta.2 (2020-10-06)

### New Features

- Developers can now subclass `TableEntity` and decorate the subclass with properties, rather than adding properties
  manually by calling `addProperty()`. Client methods that perform read operations now accept an additional parameter
  `resultType` to return the result of the read operation as the specified type instead of always returning
  `TableEntity` instances. Client methods that perform write operations accept subclasses of `TableEntity` in addition
  to instances of the base class itself. [#13692](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/13692)
- The `getEntity` methods have gained the `select` query option to allow for more efficient existence checks for a table
  entity. [#15289](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/15289)

### Breaking Changes

- The non-functional `TableClient.listEntities(options, timeout)` method was removed.

### Key Bug Fixes

- TableClientBuilder's constructor was mistakenly hidden from the public API.
  [#15294](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/15294)
- The library was missing a module-info.java. [#15296](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/15296)
- The `TableClient.updateEntity(entity)` method was mistakenly performing an upsert operation rather than an update.
- The `TableAsyncClient.updateEntity(entity)` method always returned an empty result.

### Other Changes

- The JavaDoc API documentation has been significantly improved
  [#13684](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/13684)

### Dependency Updates

- Updated dependency version of `azure-core` to 1.9.0.

## 12.0.0-beta.1 (2020-09-10)

Version 12.0.0-beta.1 is a beta of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic to
the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide
our efforts can be found in the
[Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).

### New Features

- Support for both [Azure Table storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/table-storage-overview) and
  the [Cosmos DB Table API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/table-introduction).
- Reactive streams support using [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/).
- Create, list, query, and delete tables.
- Insert, update, upsert, merge, list, query, and delete table entities.

### Known Issues

- Entity merge operations using the Cosmos DB Table API are currently broken.
- When using the Cosmos DB Table API, if a client is rate-limited by the service, the client returns the error to the
  caller rather than automatically retrying the request after a delay.
- Upon failure, operations do not correctly throw a `TableStorageException` as documented, but instead currently throw
  the internal type `TableServiceErrorException`.
