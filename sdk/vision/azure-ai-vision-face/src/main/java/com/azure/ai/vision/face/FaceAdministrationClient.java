     * Add a face to a specified Large Face List, up to 1,000,000 faces.
     *
     * To deal with an image containing multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace

     * face feature(s) will be stored on server until "Delete Large Face List Face" or "Delete Large Face List" is
     * called.
     *
     * Note that persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by "Detect".
     * &gt;
     * *
     * * Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal,
     * clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.
     * * Each person entry can hold up to 248 faces.
     * * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.
     * * "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the
     * provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from "Detect", there's no guarantee to detect and add the face
     * successfully.
     * * Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause
     * failures.
     * * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with
     * dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.
     * * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare different detection models, please refer

     *
     * Note that persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by "Detect".
     * &gt;
     * *
     * * Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal,
     * clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.
     * * Each person entry can hold up to 248 faces.
     * * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.
     * * "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the
     * provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from "Detect", there's no guarantee to detect and add the face
     * successfully.
     * * Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause
     * failures.
     * * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with
     * dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.
     * * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare different detection models, please refer
