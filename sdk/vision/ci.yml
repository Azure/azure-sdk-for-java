# Note that EnableVerifyTypeSpecCodeGeneration is set to false here in order to skip
# the task "Verify TypeSpec Code Generation" in the pipeline. This task is currenlty
# failing because the tools do not account for the additional code snippet that were
# inserted into Java source code comments (JavaDocs). This task will be enabled again
# once the tools are updated. During development of the next release of the SDK, please
# enable this check temporarly in your PRs and make sure the only difference you see
# when the "Verify TypeSpec Code Generation" task fails, is because of code snippets
# in source code comments (JavaDocs).
