[opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Getting started

Before working on a contribution, it would be beneficial to familiarize yourself with the process and guidelines used
for the Azure SDKs so that your submission is consistent with the project standards and is ready to be accepted with
fewer changes requested. In particular, it is recommended to review:

- [Azure SDK README][github-general], to learn more about the overall project and processes used.
- [Azure SDK Design Guidelines][design-guidelines], to understand the general guidelines for the SDKs across all
  languages and platforms
- [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java][java-spec], to understand the guidelines specific to the Azure SDKs for Java.

## Development environment setup

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above
- [Maven][maven]
- Git
- Microsoft Azure subscription
    - You can create a free account at: https://azure.microsoft.com
- Azure Event Hubs instance
    - Step-by-step guide for [creating an Event Hub using the Azure Portal][event_hubs_create]
- Azure Storage account
    - Step-by-step guide for [creating a Storage account using the Azure Portal][storage_account]

## Building all the client libraries

Open a command prompt/terminal:
1. Execute `git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java.git`
1. Traverse to the repository root.
1. Execute `mvn compile -f pom.client.xml`
1. Install the tooling and build the product by executing:
    * `mvn install -Dinclude-non-shipping-modules -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip -f pom.client.xml`

## Building only the Azure SDK client library for Storage Blob Checkpoint Store

After building the tooling and solution once from the section,
[Building all the client libraries](#building-all-the-client-libraries), you can build just the Azure SDK client library
 for Checkpoint store using Storage Blobs by executing:
1. `mvn compile -f sdk\eventhubs\azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob\pom.xml`

## Running tests

After following instructions in [Building all the client libraries](#building-all-the-client-libraries), you can run the
unit tests by executing:
1. `mvn test -f sdk\eventhubs\azure-messaging-eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob\pom.xml`

For unit tests, there are no special considerations; these are self-contained and execute locally without any reliance
on external resources. These tests are run for all PR validations.

## Logging output

Log messages can be seen in the output window by:
1. Setting `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` to the desired verbosity. Log levels can be found in [ClientLogger][log-level]
1. Adding an implementation of [slf4j][slf4j] to the classpath. Implementations can be found under section "[Binding with a
   logging framework at deployment time][slf4j-implementations]".
