/**
 * A <b>synchronous</b> producer responsible for transmitting {@link EventData} to a specific Event Hub, grouped
 * together in batches. Depending on the {@link CreateBatchOptions options} specified when creating an
 * {@link EventDataBatch}, the events may be automatically routed to an available partition or specific to a partition.
 *
 * <p>
 * Allowing automatic routing of partitions is recommended when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The sending of events needs to be highly available.</li>
 * <li>The event data should be evenly distributed among all available partitions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * If no partition id is specified, the following rules are used for automatically selecting one:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Distribute the events equally amongst all available partitions using a round-robin approach.</li>
 * <li>If a partition becomes unavailable, the Event Hubs service will automatically detect it and forward the
 * message to another available partition.</li>
 * </ol>
