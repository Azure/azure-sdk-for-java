/**
 * A producer responsible for transmitting {@link EventData} to a specific Event Hub, grouped together in batches.
 * Depending on the options specified at creation, the producer may be created to allow event data to be automatically
 * routed to an available partition or specific to a partition.
 *
 * <p>
 * Allowing automatic routing of partitions is recommended when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The sending of events needs to be highly available.</li>
 * <li>The event data should be evenly distributed among all available partitions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If no {@link SendOptions#getPartitionId() partitionId} is specified, the following rules are used for
 * automatically selecting one:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Distribute the events equally amongst all available partitions using a round-robin approach.</li>
 * <li>If a partition becomes unavailable, the Event Hubs service will automatically detect it and forward the
 * message to another available partition.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Create a producer that routes events to any partition</strong></p>
 * To allow automatic routing of messages to available partition, do not specify the {@link
 * SendOptions#getPartitionId() partitionId} when creating the {@link EventHubProducerClient}.
 *
 * {@codesnippet com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventhubproducerclient.instantiation}
 *
 * <p><strong>Create a producer that publishes events to partition "foo" with a timeout of 45 seconds.</strong></p>
 * Developers can push events to a single partition by specifying the
 * {@link SendOptions#setPartitionId(String) partitionId} when creating an {@link EventHubProducerClient}.
 *
 * {@codesnippet com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventhubproducerclient.instantiation#partitionId}
 *
 * <p><strong>Publish events to the same partition, grouped together using {@link SendOptions#setPartitionKey(String)}
 * </strong></p>
 * If developers want to push similar events to end up at the same partition, but do not require them to go to a
 * specific partition, they can use {@link SendOptions#setPartitionKey(String)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * In the sample below, all the "sandwiches" end up in the same partition, but it could end up in partition 0, 1, etc.
 * of the available partitions. All that matters to the end user is that they are grouped together.
 * </p>
 *
 * {@codesnippet com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventhubproducerclient.send#publisher-sendOptions}
 *
 * <p><strong>Publish events using an {@link EventDataBatch}</strong></p>
 * Developers can create an {@link EventDataBatch}, add the events they want into it, and publish these events together.
 * When creating a {@link EventDataBatch batch}, developers can specify a set of {@link BatchOptions options} to
 * configure this batch.
 *
 * <p>
 * In the scenario below, the developer is creating a networked video game. They want to receive telemetry about their
 * users' gaming systems, but do not want to slow down the network with telemetry. So they limit the size of their
 * {@link EventDataBatch batches} to be no larger than 256 bytes. The events within the batch also get hashed to the
 * same partition because they all share the same {@link BatchOptions#getPartitionKey()}.
 * </p>
 * {@codesnippet com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventhubproducerclient.send#eventDataBatch}
 *
 * @see EventHubClient#createProducer()
 * @see EventHubProducerAsyncClient To asynchronously generate events to an Event Hub, see EventHubAsyncProducer.
