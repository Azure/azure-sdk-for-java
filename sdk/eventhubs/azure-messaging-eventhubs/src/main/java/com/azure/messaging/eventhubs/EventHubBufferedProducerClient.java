/**
 * A client responsible for publishing instances of {@link EventData} to a specific Event Hub.  Depending on the options
 * specified when events are enqueued, they may be automatically assigned to a partition, grouped according to the
 * specified partition key, or assigned a specifically requested partition.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClient} does not publish immediately, instead using a deferred model where events
 * are collected into a buffer so that they may be efficiently batched and published when the batch is full or the
 * {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClientBuilder#maxWaitTime(Duration) maxWaitTime} has elapsed with no new events
 * enqueued.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This model is intended to shift the burden of batch management from callers, at the cost of non-deterministic timing,
 * for when events will be published. There are additional trade-offs to consider, as well:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the application crashes, events in the buffer will not have been published.  To
 * prevent data loss, callers are encouraged to track publishing progress using
 * {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClientBuilder#onSendBatchFailed(Consumer) onSendBatchFailed} and
 * {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClientBuilder#onSendBatchSucceeded(Consumer) onSendBatchSucceeded}.</li>
 * <li>Events specifying a partition key may be assigned a different partition than those
 * using the same key with other producers.</li>
 * <li>In the unlikely event that a partition becomes temporarily unavailable,
 * the {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClient} may take longer to recover than other producers.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In scenarios where it is important to have events published immediately with a deterministic outcome, ensure that
 * partition keys are assigned to a partition consistent with other publishers, or where maximizing availability is a
 * requirement, using {@link EventHubProducerAsyncClient} or {@link EventHubProducerClient} is recommended.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Sample: Creating an {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClient}</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>The following code sample demonstrates the creation of the synchronous client
 * {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClient}.  The {@code fullyQualifiedNamespace} is the Event Hubs Namespace's host
 * name. It is listed under the "Essentials" panel after navigating to the Event Hubs Namespace via Azure Portal.
 * The producer is set to publish events every 60 seconds with a buffer size of 1500 events for each partition.  The
 * examples shown in this document use a credential object named DefaultAzureCredential for
 * authentication, which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production
 * environments. Additionally, we recommend using
 * <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/">managed identity</a>
 * for authentication in production environments. You can find more information on different ways of authenticating and
 * their corresponding credential types in the
 * <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme">Azure Identity documentation</a>.</p>

 * {@link EventHubBufferedProducerClientBuilder#maxWaitTime(Duration)} has elapsed, the buffer is full, or no more
