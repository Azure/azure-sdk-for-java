# Azure Cognitive Services Health Insights Cancer Profiling client library for Java

[Health Insights][health_insights] is an Azure Applied AI Service built with the Azure Cognitive Services Framework, that leverages multiple Cognitive Services, Healthcare API services and other Azure resources.

The [Cancer Profiling model][cancer_profiling_docs] receives clinical records of oncology patients and outputs cancer staging, such as clinical stage TNM categories and pathologic stage TNM categories as well as tumor site, histology.
[Source code][source_code] | [Package (Maven)][package] | [API reference documentation][cancer_profiling_api_documentation] | [Product Documentation][product_documentation] | [Samples][samples_location]


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link] with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- An existing Cognitive Services Health Insights instance.

For more information about creating the resource or how to get the location and sku information see [here][cognitive_resource_cli].

### Include the Package

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-health-insights-cancerprofiling;current})

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-health-insights-cancerprofiling</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.1</version>
</dependency>
```

[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Health Insights Cancer Profiling service, you'll need to create an instance of the [`CancerProfilingClient`][cancer_profiling_client_class] class. You will need an **endpoint** and an **API key** to instantiate a client object.  

#### Get API Key

You can obtain the endpoint and API key from the resource information in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal].

Alternatively, you can use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below to get the API key from the Health Insights resource.

```bash
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

#### Create a CancerProfilingClient with an API Key Credential

Once you have the value for the API key, you can pass it as a string into an instance of **AzureKeyCredential**. Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:

```Java com.azure.health.insights.cancerprofiling.buildasyncclient
String endpoint = Configuration.getGlobalConfiguration().get("AZURE_HEALTH_INSIGHTS_ENDPOINT");
String apiKey = Configuration.getGlobalConfiguration().get("AZURE_HEALTH_INSIGHTS_API_KEY");

CancerProfilingAsyncClient asyncClient = new CancerProfilingClientBuilder()
    .endpoint(endpoint)
    .serviceVersion(CancerProfilingServiceVersion.getLatest())
    .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
    .buildAsyncClient();
```

## Key concepts

The Cancer Profiling model allows you to infer cancer attributes such as tumor site, histology, clinical stage TNM categories and pathologic stage TNM categories from unstructured clinical documents.

## Examples

Infer key cancer attributes such as tumor site, histology, clinical stage TNM categories and pathologic stage TNM categories from a patient's unstructured clinical documents.
