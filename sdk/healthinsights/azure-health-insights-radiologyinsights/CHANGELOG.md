## 1.0.0-beta.1 (2024-02-15)

- Initial preview of the Azure Health Insights Radiology Insights client library.

### Features Added
* Radiology Insights API: Scans radiology reports as text to provide quality checks as feedback on errors and inconsistencies (mismatches). Critical findings are identified and communicated using the full context of the report. Follow-up recommendations and clinical findings with measurements (sizes) documented by the radiologist are also identified.
