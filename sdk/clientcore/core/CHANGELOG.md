## 1.0.0-beta.7 (2025-03-12)

### Breaking Changes
 - API updates to refactor and cleanup public APIs [#44565](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/44565), [#44555](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/44555) and [#44592](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/44592)

## 1.0.0-beta.6 (2025-03-10)

### Breaking Changes

- `JsonNumber` previously would use `float` when the floating point number was small enough to fit in `float` but it
  now aligns behavior with `JsonReader.readUntyped()` where `double` will be the smallest floating point type used.
  This aligns with floating point number behavior in Java where `double` is the default if no type is specified.
- Support for special numeric `INF`, `-INF`, and `+INF` values have been removed to align with behaviors of `Float`
  and `Double` in Java where only the `Infinity` variants are supported.

### Bugs Fixed

- `JsonReader.readUntyped()` had incomplete support for untyped numerics. Numerics too large for `double` and `long` are
  now supported and a bug where exponents were not being parsed correctly is fixed.
