/**
 * <p>Specifies HTTP options for conditional requests based on modification time and ETag matching.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@link HttpMatchConditions} and adds conditions based on the modification time of the resource.
 * It encapsulates conditions such as If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since, in addition to If-Match and
 * If-None-Match from {@link HttpMatchConditions}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is useful when you want to create an HTTP request with conditional headers based on the modification
 * time of the resource and ETag matching. For example, you can use it to create a GET request that only retrieves the
 * resource if it has been modified since a specific time, or a PUT request that only updates the resource if it
 * has not been modified by another client since a specific time.</p>
