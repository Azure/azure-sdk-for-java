/**
 * Enum representing where in an {@link HttpPipeline} a given {@link HttpPipelinePolicy} is positioned when added to an
 * {@link HttpPipelineBuilder}.
 * <p>
 * By default, policies are added at {@link #BETWEEN_RETRY_AND_AUTHENTICATION} with the assumption of
 * {@link HttpPipelinePolicy policies} are idempotent and may need to be updated each time a network request is sent
 * (each try) and may mutate the results of authentication policies.
 * <p>
 * HttpPipelineOrder ensures that the creation of an {@link HttpPipeline} follows a strict ordering of policies. This
 * ordering is based on what is believed to be the best order of policy execution. Here is a visual representation of
 * the order of policies in an {@link HttpPipeline}:
 * <pre>
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     | Policies before redirect |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |     Redirect Policy      |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |     Between redirect     |
 *     |        and retry         |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |       Retry Policy       |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |      Between retry       |
 *     |    and authentication    |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |  Authentication Policy   |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |  Between authentication  |
 *     |   and instrumentation    |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |  Instrumentation Policy  |
 *     +--------------------------+
 *     |      Policies after      |
 *     |     instrumentation      |
