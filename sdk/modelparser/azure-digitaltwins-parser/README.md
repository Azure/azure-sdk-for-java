# Azure IoT DigitalTwins Model Parser client library for Java

This library provides functionality for interacting with Azure DigitalTwins Models.


## Getting started

The complete Microsoft Azure SDK can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Azure downloads][microsoft_sdk_download] page, and it ships with support for building deployment packages, integrating with tooling, rich command line tooling, and more.

For the best development experience, developers should use the official Microsoft Maven packages for libraries. Maven packages will be regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes.
