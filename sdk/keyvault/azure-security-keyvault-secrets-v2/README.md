# Azure Key Vault Secrets client library for Java
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage for secrets, such as passwords and database connection
strings.

The Azure Key Vault Secrets client library allows you to securely store and tightly control the access to tokens,
passwords, API keys, and other secrets. This library offers operations to create, retrieve, update, delete, purge,
backup, restore, and list the secrets and its versions.

Use the Azure Key Vault Secrets client library to create and manage secrets.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- A [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link], version 8 or later.
    - Here are details about [Java 8 client compatibility with Azure Certificate Authority][azure_ca].
- An [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription].
- An existing [Azure Key Vault][azure_keyvault]. If you need to create a key vault, you can do so in the Azure Portal by
following the steps in [this document][azure_keyvault_portal]. Alternatively, you can use the Azure CLI by following the
steps in [this document][azure_keyvault_cli].

### Adding the package to your product

#### Use the Azure SDK BOM
Please include the `azure-sdk-bom` to your project to take dependency on the General Availability (GA) version of the
library. In the following snippet, replace the {bom_version_to_target} placeholder with the version number. To learn
more about the BOM, see the [AZURE SDK BOM README][azure_sdk_bom].

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure.v2</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

and then include the direct dependency in the dependencies section without the version tag as shown below.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure.v2</groupId>
        <artifactId>azure-security-keyvault-secrets</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Use a direct dependency
If you want to take dependency on a particular version of the library that is not present in the BOM, add the direct
dependency to your project as follows.

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure.v2:azure-security-keyvault-secrets;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure.v2</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-security-keyvault-secrets</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta.1</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Authentication
In order to interact with the Azure Key Vault service, you will need to create an instance of the
[`SecretClient`](#create-secret-client) class, a vault **endpoint** and a credential object. The examples shown in this
document use a credential object named  [`DefaultAzureCredential`][default_azure_credential], which is appropriate for
most scenarios, including local development and production environments. Additionally, we recommend using a
[managed identity][managed_identity] for authentication in production environments.

You can find more information on different ways of authenticating and their corresponding credential types in the
[Azure Identity documentation][azure_identity].

#### Create secret client
Once you perform [the authentication set up that suits you best][default_azure_credential] and replaced
**your-key-vault-endpoint** with the URL for your key vault, you can create a `SecretClient`:

```java readme-sample-createSecretClient
```

## Key concepts

### Secret
A secret is the fundamental resource within Azure Key Vault. From a developer's perspective, Key Vault APIs accept and
return secret values as strings. In addition to the secret data, the following attributes may be specified:
* **enabled:** Specifies whether the secret data can be retrieved.
* **notBefore:** Identifies the time after which the secret will be active.
* **expires:** Identifies the expiration time on or after which the secret data should not be retrieved.
* **created:** Indicates when this version of the secret was created.
* **updated:** Indicates when this version of the secret was updated.

### Secret client:
The secret client performs interactions with the Azure Key Vault service for getting, setting, updating, deleting, and
listing secrets and its versions. Once you've initialized a secret, you can interact with the primary resource types in
Key Vault.

## Examples
The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Azure Key Vault Secret service
tasks, including:
- [Create a secret](#create-a-secret)
- [Retrieve a secret](#retrieve-a-secret)
- [Update an existing secret](#update-an-existing-secret)
- [Delete a secret](#delete-a-secret)
- [List secrets](#list-secrets)

### Create a secret
Create a secret to be stored in the key vault.
- `setSecret` creates a new secret in the key vault. If a secret with the given name already exists then a new version
of the secret is created.

```java readme-sample-createSecret
```

### Retrieve a secret
Retrieve a previously stored secret by calling `getSecret`.

```java readme-sample-retrieveSecret
```

### Update an existing secret
Update an existing secret by calling `updateSecretProperties`.

```java readme-sample-updateSecret
```

### Delete a secret
Delete an existing secret by calling `beginDeleteSecret`.

```java readme-sample-deleteSecret
```

### List secrets
List the secrets in the key vault by calling `listPropertiesOfSecrets`.

```java readme-sample-listSecrets
```

### Service API versions

The client library targets the latest service API version by default. The service client builder accepts an optional
service API version parameter to specify which API version to communicate.

#### Select a service API version

You have the flexibility to explicitly select a supported service API version when initializing a service client via the
service client builder. This ensures that the client can communicate with services using the specified API version.

When selecting an API version, it is important to verify that there are no breaking changes compared to the latest API
version. If there are significant differences, API calls may fail due to incompatibility.

Always ensure that the chosen API version is fully supported and operational for your specific use case and that it
aligns with the service's versioning policy.

## Troubleshooting
See our [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting_guide] for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

### General
Azure Key Vault clients raise exceptions. For example, if you try to retrieve a secret after it is deleted a `404` error
is returned, indicating the resource was not found. In the following snippet, the error is handled gracefully by
catching the exception and displaying additional information about the error.

```java readme-sample-troubleshooting
```

### Default HTTP Client
<!-- TODO (vcolin7): Update with default client after discussing with the team. -->
All client libraries by default use the Netty HTTP client. Adding the above dependency will automatically configure the
client library to use the Netty HTTP client. Configuring or changing the HTTP client is detailed in the
[HTTP clients wiki][http_clients_wiki].

### Default SSL library
<!-- TODO (vcolin7): Confirm if we're still using the Boring SSL library with clientcore/azure-core-v2. -->
All client libraries, by default, use the Tomcat-native Boring SSL library to enable native-level performance for SSL
operations. The Boring SSL library is an Uber JAR containing native libraries for Linux / macOS / Windows, and provides
better performance compared to the default SSL implementation within the JDK. For more information, including how to
reduce the dependency size, refer to the [performance tuning][performance_tuning] section of the wiki.

## Next steps
Several Azure Key Vault Java client library samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository. These samples
provide example code for additional scenarios commonly encountered while working with Azure Key Vault.

## Next steps samples
Samples are explained in detail [here][samples_readme].
