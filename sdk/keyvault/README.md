Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage of certificates, cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services.

Azure Key Vault Managed HSM is a fully-managed, highly-available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service that enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys for your cloud applications using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.

For more information refer to [About Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) and [What is Azure Key Vault Managed HSM?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview).
