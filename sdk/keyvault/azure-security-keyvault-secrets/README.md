[Azure Key Vault][product_docs] is a cloud service that provides secure storage for secrets, such as passwords and database connection strings.

The Azure Key Vault Secrets client library allows you to securely store and tightly control the access to tokens, passwords, API keys, and other secrets. This library offers operations to create, retrieve, update, delete, purge, backup, restore, and list the secrets and its versions.

Use the Azure Key Vault Secrets client library to create and manage secrets.

## Getting started

The Azure SDK for Java offers a comprehensive collection of libraries, all of which are conveniently accessible on Maven Central under the [com.azure](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/com.azure) namespace. The `azure-security-keyvault-secrets` library is available [here on Maven Central][maven_package]. In addition to this, the library is also referenced in the `azure-sdk-bom`, making it easier for you to navigate and locate the latest versions of all libraries. Microsoft Azure SDK best practice is to use the Azure SDK BOM to manage your dependencies. To use the Azure SDK BOM, follow our [Maven][bom_maven] and [Gradle][bom_gradle] docs. With the Azure SDK for Java BOM, you would add the following to your Maven *pom.xml* file:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
        <artifactId>azure-security-keyvault-secrets</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

> **TODO** I want to auto-refresh the *{bom_version_to_target}* text with the latest BOM version, rather than have it be a placeholder and an exercise left to the reader.

Additionally, for projects using Maven as their build tool, Microsoft Azure SDK best practice is to use the [Maven Build Tool plugin][maven_build_tool], as this will ensure all Azure SDK best practices are being followed.
## Authentication

This client library supports the authentication via Microsoft Entra ID.

Authentication is a complex topic, but fortunately there are [conceptual docs][azure_identity_concepts] and detailed [reference docs][azure_identity_ref_docs]. You can also [read through the samples for this library][samples], as these show precisely how to authenticate clients in this library.

## Creating a Client

With all of the links provided above, you should have ample guidance on most aspects of using this library. To make this concrete, the code snippets below show the critical code required to create a new client, including authentication. For more in-depth code snippets, refer to the [samples][samples] package.

### Using Microsoft Entra ID Token

Here we demonstrate using [DefaultAzureCredential][azure_identity_DAC] to authenticate as a service principal. However, the configuration client accepts any [azure-identity credential][azure_identity_concepts].

```java readme-sample-createSecretClient
SecretClient secretClient = new SecretClientBuilder()
    .vaultUrl("<your-key-vault-url>")
    .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
    .buildClient();
```

> NOTE: For using an asynchronous client use `SecretAsyncClient` instead of `SecretClient` and call `buildAsyncClient()`.


## Key concepts

Key concepts, code examples, and usage instructions for this library are discussed in great detail in the [Key Vault ref docs][api_documentation].

## Examples

There are comprehensive code samples available from the following links:

- [Create a secret][sample_create_secret]
- [Retrieve a secret][sample_retrieve_secret]
- [Update an existing secret][sample_update_existing_secret]
- [Delete a secret][sample_delete_secret]
- [List secrets][sample_list_secrets]

## Troubleshooting
See our [Key Vault Secrets troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) f for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios related specifically to this library. Additionally, refer to the [Azure SDK for Java troubleshooting][troubleshooting-guide] page to learn more about how to get started with troubleshooting issues when using the Azure SDK for Java client libraries.
