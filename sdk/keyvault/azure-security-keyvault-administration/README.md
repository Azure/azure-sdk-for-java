# Azure Key Vault Administration library for Java

## Getting started
### Adding the package to your project
Maven dependency for the Azure Key Vault Administration library. Add it to your project's POM file.

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-security-keyvault-administration;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-security-keyvault-administration</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0-beta.1</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- An existing [Azure Key Vault][azure_keyvault]. If you need to create a Key Vault, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) to create one with this Azure CLI command. Replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-key-vault-name>` with your own, unique names:

    ```Bash
    az keyvault create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-key-vault-name>
    ```

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Azure Key Vault service, you'll need to create an instance of the [KeyClient](#create-key-client) class. You would need a **vault url** and **client secret credentials (client id, client secret, tenant id)** to instantiate a client object using the default `DefaultAzureCredential` examples shown in this document.

The `DefaultAzureCredential` way of authentication by providing client secret credentials is being used in this getting started section but you can find more ways to authenticate with [azure-identity][azure_identity].

#### Create/Get credentials
To create/get client secret credentials you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_create_application_in_portal], [Azure CLI][azure_keyvault_cli_full] or [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash)

Here is an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) snippet below to

 * Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:

    ```Bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name> --skip-assignment
    ```

    Output:

    ```json
    {
        "appId": "generated-app-ID",
        "displayName": "dummy-app-name",
        "name": "http://dummy-app-name",
        "password": "random-password",
        "tenant": "tenant-ID"
    }
    ```

* Use the above returned credentials information to set the **AZURE_CLIENT_ID** (appId), **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET** (password), and **AZURE_TENANT_ID** (tenantId) environment variables. The following example shows a way to do this in Bash:

    ```Bash
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated-app-ID"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random-password"
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant-ID"
    ```

* Use the aforementioned Key Vault name to retrieve details of your Key Vault, which also contain your Key Vault URL:

    ```Bash
    az keyvault show --name <your-key-vault-name>
    ```

### Default HTTP client
All client libraries by default use the Netty HTTP client. Adding the above dependency will automatically configure the client library to use the Netty HTTP client. Configuring or changing the HTTP client is detailed in the [HTTP clients wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/HTTP-clients).

### Default SSL library
All client libraries, by default, use the Tomcat-native Boring SSL library to enable native-level performance for SSL operations. The Boring SSL library is an Uber JAR containing native libraries for Linux / macOS / Windows, and provides better performance compared to the default SSL implementation within the JDK. For more information, including how to reduce the dependency size, refer to the [performance tuning][performance_tuning] section of the wiki.

## Next steps
Several Key Vault Java SDK samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository. These samples provide example code for additional scenarios commonly encountered while working with Azure Key Vault.

## Next steps samples
Samples are explained in detail [here][samples_readme].
