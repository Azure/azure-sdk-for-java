# Release History

## 4.1.0-beta.1 (Unreleased)


## 4.0.0 (2021-06-17)
- Initial release of `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` and `KeyVaultAccessControlAsyncClient` to manage role assignments and definitions for Managed HSM.
- Initial release of `KeyVaultBackupClient` and `KeyVaultBackupAsyncClient` to backup and restore Managed HSM.

### Features Added
- Changed default service version to `7.2`.
- Added `KeyVaultKeyIdentifier` to parse key URLs.
- Added local-only support for `CryptographyClient` and `CryptographyAsyncClient` by providing a `JsonWebKey` during client creation.
- Added `KeyType.OCT-HSM` to support oct-HSM key operations to support Managed HSM.
- Added the `CreateOctKeyOptions` class and associated `createOctKey()` methods.
- Added AES-GCM and AES-CBC support for encrypting and decrypting, including new `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` overloads.
- Added the ability to set a public exponent on RSA keys during creation.
- Made all getters for properties of a `JsonWebKey` public.

### Changes since 4.0.0-beta.7

#### Bug Fixes
- Ensured that `RetryPolicy` and `HttpLogOptions` use a default implementation when creating Key Vault clients if not set or set to `null`.

#### Breaking Changes 
- Renamed `beginSelectiveRestore()` to `beginSelectiveKeyRestore()` in `KeyVaultBackupClient` and `KeyVaultBackupAsyncClient`. Made the aforementioned operation return the new `KeyVaultSelectiveKeyRestoreOperation` instead of a `KeyVaultRestoreOperation`.
- Changed the final return type of `beginRestore()` and `beginSelectiveKeyRestore()`'s poller types from `Void` to the new `KeyVaultRestoreResult` and `KeyVaultSelectiveKeyRestoreResult`, respectively.
- `KeyVaultBackupClient` and `KeyVaultBackupAsyncClient`'s long-running operations now throw a `RuntimeException` when cancellation is attempted, as it is not currently supported.
- Made `KeyVaultRoleDefinition` flat, as opposed to it having a `KeyVaultRoleDefinitionProperties` member with more properties inside of it.
- Moved `roleScope` from `KeyVaultRoleAssignment` to `KeyVaultRoleAssignmentProperties` and renamed it to `scope`.
- Moved `SetRoleDefinitionOptions` from the `options` package to the `models` package.
- Removed `roleType` from `SetRoleDefinitionOptions`.
- Removed service method overloads that take a `pollingInterval`, since `PollerFlux` and `SyncPoller` objects allow for setting this value directly on them.
- Delete methods on the `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` now return a `void` or `Mono<Void>` and ignore HTTP `404`s.
- Renamed `jobId` and `getJobId()` to `operationId` and `getOperationId()` in `KeyVaultLongRunningOperation` and its children classes.
- Made the following classes `final`:
    - `KeyVaultDataAction`
    - `KeyVaultRoleDefinitionType`
    - `KeyVaultRoleType`
    - `SetRoleDefinitionOptions`

## 4.0.0-beta.7 (2021-05-15)

### New features

- Removed the use of `KeyVaultRoleAssignmentProperties` in clients' public APIs in favor of using the `roleDefinitionId` and `servicePrincipalId` values directly.

## 4.0.0-beta.2 (2020-10-09)

### New Features
