# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.1 (Unreleased)

Version 1.0.0-beta.1 is preview of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic 
to the Java ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible. The principles that guide 
our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html).

This package's 
[documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/translation/azure-ai-translation-document/README.md) 
and 
[samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/translation/azure-ai-translation-document/src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/translation/document) 
demonstrate the new API.

- Initial release. Please see the README and wiki for information on the new design.
