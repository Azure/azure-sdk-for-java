# Azure AD Spring Boot Starter client library for Java

With Spring Starter for Azure Active Directory, now you can get started quickly to build the authentication workflow for a web application that uses Azure AD and OAuth 2.0 to secure its back end. It also enables developers to create a role based authorization workflow for a Web API secured by Azure AD, with the power of the Spring Security Filter Chain. 

[Package (Maven)][package] | [API reference documentation][refdocs] | [Product documentation][docs] | [Samples][sample]

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link] with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 and above

### Register the Application in Azure AD
* **Register a new application**: Go to Azure Portal - Azure Active Directory - App registrations - New application registration to register the application in Azure Active Directory.  `Application ID` is `client-id` in `application.properties`.
* **Grant permissions to the application**: After application registration succeeded, go to API ACCESS - Required permissions - DELEGATED PERMISSIONS, tick `Access the directory as the signed-in user` and `Sign in and read user profile`. Click `Grant Permissions` (Note: you will need administrator privilege to grant permission).
* **Create a client secret key for the application**: Go to API ACCESS - Keys to create a secret key (`client-secret`).

## Key concepts
This package provides 2 ways to integrate with Spring Security and authenticate with Azure Active Directory, which are designed for scenarios of web application and resource server.

The authorization flow for web application includes:
* Login with credentials by self-defined `azure` client registration and trigger **authorization code flow**. Application gets user's consent for all configured scopes except on-demand resources' scopes, and acquires an access token only for scopes of `openid, profile, offline_access, https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`.
* When other resources are visited, associated clients will be loaded to trigger **refresh token flow** for authorization, and acquire an access token for configured scopes of that resource.
* When on-demand resources are visited, associated clients will be loaded and trigger **authorization code flow** like the `azure` client.

The authorization flow for resource server:

* Login with credentials and validate id_token from Azure AD 
* Get On-Behalf-Of token and membership info from Azure AD Graph API
* Evaluate the permission based on membership info to grant or deny access

### Configurable properties
This starter provides following properties to be customized:


| Properties                                                        | Description                                                         |

### Web application
Based on Azure AD as a Web application, it uses OAuth2 authorization code flow to authentication, and authorizes resources based on the groups or roles claim in the access token.
This starter provides a convenient way to quickly access resource servers.
1. Resource servers should be registered as `ClientRegistration`.
2. In Controller, `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` can be used to  get `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`. 
   `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` contains accessToken to access related client resource.
   
#### On-demand authorization
By default, the starter will launch the Oauth2 Authorization Code flow for a logging in user. During the authorization flow, `azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory` adds all the configured scopes except **on-demand** ones into authorization code requests to ask for user's authorization consent. The authorization flow of `on-demand` resources will be launched at the first time the user wants to access them.

#### Standalone web application
Only as a Web application, no further access to other resources protected by Azure AD.
![Standalone Web Application](resource/aad-based-standalone-web-application.png)

* Access restricted resources of web application, login with credentials using default scopes of `openid, profile, offline_access, https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`.
* Return secured data.

#### Web application visit other resource servers
Web application visits resource servers which are protected by Azure AD.
![Web Application Access Resources](resource/add-based-web-application-access-resources.png)

* Login with credentials, the scope includes default scopes and all configured scopes. 
* Auto-acquire the access token of other clients based on the root refresh token.
* Use each client's access token to request restricted resource.
* Return secured data.

### Resource Server
Based on Azure AD as a Resource Server, it uses `BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter` authorize request. The current resource server also can access other resources, there's a similar method to the web application usage to obtain access to the client access token, the difference is the access token obtained based on the `MSAL On-Behalf-Of` process.

#### Standalone resource server
Only as a Resource Server, no further access to other resources protected by Azure AD.
![Standalone resource server usage](resource/add-based-standalone-resource-server.png)

* Access restricted resources of Resource Server.
* Validate access token.
* Return secured data.

#### Resource server access other resources
Resource server accesses other resource servers which are protected by Azure AD.
![Resource Server Access Other Resources](resource/add-based-resource-server-access-other-resources.png)

* Access restricted resources related to Graph and Custom resources through resource server.
* Auto On-Behalf-Of to request an access token for other clients.
* Use each client's access token to request restricted resource.
* Return secured data.

## Examples
Refer to different samples for different authentication ways. 

### [Web APP] Authenticate in web app
Please refer to [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-webapp] for authenticate in web apps.

####  Configure application.yml:
```yaml
azure:
  activedirectory:
    tenant-id: xxxxxx-your-tenant-id-xxxxxx
    client-id: xxxxxx-your-client-id-xxxxxx
    client-secret: xxxxxx-your-client-secret-xxxxxx
    user-group:
      allowed-groups: group1, group2
    post-logout-redirect-uri: http://localhost:8080 # optional
```

#### If you want to create your own configuration class:
<!-- embedme ../azure-spring-boot/src/samples/java/com/azure/spring/aad/AADOAuth2LoginConfigSample.java#L18-L26 -->
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADOAuth2LoginConfigSample extends AADWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        super.configure(http);
    }
}
```

### [Web APP] Configure scopes of multiple resources
By default, `azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory` configures scopes of `openid`, `profile` and `https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read` to implement OpenID Connect protocol and access of membership information of logging in users.

To customize scope configurations of multiple resources, developers need to configure the registration id and scopes in the `application.yml` as needed. Here the {registration-id} is defined by developers themselves to generate correspondding `OAuth2AuthorizedClient` to acquire access tokens, and scope names should follow the specification of `resource-uri/permission`.
```yaml
azure:
  activedirectory:
    authorization-clients:
      graph:
        scopes: https://graph.microsoft.com/Analytics.Read, email
      {registration-id}:
        scopes: {scope1}, {scope2}
``` 

### [Web APP] Configure on-demand resource authorization
To configure the authorization of certain resource as on-demand, developers need to add following property in `application.yml`:
```yaml
azure:
  activedirectory:
    authorization-clients:
      {registration-id}:
        on-demand: true
        scopes: {scope1}, {scope2}
```

### [Web API] Protect the resource APIs in resource server
Please refer to [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-resource-server] for access resource APIs.

#### Using `AADOAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfig` to extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`:
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADOAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests((requests) -> requests.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt()
            .jwtAuthenticationConverter(new AzureJwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter());
    }
}
```

### [Web API] OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow
Please refer [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-resource-server-obo] to for access On-Behalf-Of flow.

#### Configure application.yml:
```yaml
azure:
   activedirectory:
      client-id: <Web-API-A-client-id>
      client-secret: <Web-API-A-client-secret>
      tenant-id: <Tenant-id-registered-by-application>
      app-id-uri: <Web-API-A-app-id-url>
      authorization-clients:
         graph:
            scopes:
               - https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read
         custom:
            scopes:
               - <Web-API-B-app-id-url>/File.Read
```

#### Support the use of `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` to get `OAuth2AuthorizedClient`:
```java
 @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_Obo.Graph.Read')")
 @GetMapping("call-graph")
 public String callGraph(@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("graph") OAuth2AuthorizedClient graph) {
     return callMicrosoftGraphMeEndpoint(graph);
 }
 
 @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_Obo.File.Read')")
 @GetMapping("call-custom")
 public String callCustom(@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("custom") OAuth2AuthorizedClient custom) {
     return callCustomEndpoint(custom);
 }
```

### [Web API] (Deprecated) Authenticate in web API by a filter
Please refer to [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-resource-server-by-filter] for how to integrate Spring Security and Azure AD for authentication and authorization in a Single Page Application (SPA) scenario.

#### Configure application.yml:
```yaml
azure:
  activedirectory:
    client-id: xxxxxx-your-client-id-xxxxxx
    client-secret: xxxxxx-your-client-secret-xxxxxx
    user-group:
      allowed-groups: group1, group2
```

#### Autowire `AADAuthenticationFilter` in `WebSecurityConfig.java` file
<!-- embedme ../azure-spring-boot/src/samples/java/com/azure/spring/aad/AADAuthenticationFilterConfigSample.java#L18-L23 -->
```java
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true, prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADAuthenticationFilterConfigSample extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private AADAuthenticationFilter aadAuthFilter;
}
```

* Role-based Authorization with annotation `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('GROUP_NAME')")`
* Role-based Authorization with method `isMemberOf()`

### [Web API] (Deprecated) Authenticate stateless web API by a filter, using AAD app roles
This scenario fits best for stateless Spring backends exposing an API to SPAs ([OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow]) or service-to-service access using the [client credentials grant flow].
The stateless processing can be activated with the `azure.activedirectory.session-stateless` property. The authorization is using the [AAD App Roles feature], so instead of using the `groups` claim the token has a `roles` claim which contains roles [configured in your manifest]. 

#### Configure your `application.yml`:
```yaml
azure:
  activedirectory:
    session-stateless: true
  client-id: xxxxxx-your-client-id-xxxxxx
```

#### Define your roles in your application registration manifest: 
```json
  "appRoles": [
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "User"
      ],
      "displayName": "My demo",
      "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "description": "My demo role.",
      "value": "MY_ROLE"
    }
  ],
```

#### Autowire the auth filter and attach it to the filter chain:
<!-- embedme ../azure-spring-boot/src/samples/java/com/azure/spring/aad/AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilterConfigSample.java#L22-L37 -->
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilterConfigSample extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilter appRoleAuthFilter;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
            .and()
            .addFilterBefore(appRoleAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    }

}
```

* Role-based Authorization with annotation `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('MY_ROLE')")`
* Role-based Authorization with method `isMemberOf()`

The roles you want to use within your application have to be [set up in the manifest of your application registration].

### [Web APP & Web API] Use Azure China instead of Azure Global
If you use [Azure China] instead of **Azure Global**, you need to configure your `application.yml`:
```yaml
azure:
  activedirectory:
    base-uri: https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn
    graph-membership-uri: https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn/v1.0/me/memberOf
```

## Troubleshooting
### Enable client logging
Azure SDKs for Java offers a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Enable Spring logging
Spring allow all the supported logging systems to set logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) by using `logging.level.<logger-name>=<level>` where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.

The following example shows potential logging settings in `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```

For more information about setting logging in spring, please refer to the [official doc].
