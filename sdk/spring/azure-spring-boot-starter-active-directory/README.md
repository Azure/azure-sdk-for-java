# Azure AD Spring Boot Starter client library for Java

With Spring Starter for Azure Active Directory, now you can get started quickly to build the authentication workflow for a web application that uses Azure AD and OAuth 2.0 to secure its back end. It also enables developers to create a role based authorization workflow for a Web API secured by Azure AD, with the power of the Spring Security Filter Chain. 

[Package (Maven)][package] | [API reference documentation][refdocs] | [Product documentation][docs] | [Samples][sample]

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link] with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 and above

### Register the Application in Azure AD
* **Register a new application**: Go to Azure Portal - Azure Active Directory - App registrations - New application registration to register the application in Azure Active Directory.  `Application ID` is `client-id` in `application.properties`.
* **Grant permissions to the application**: After application registration succeeded, go to API ACCESS - Required permissions - DELEGATED PERMISSIONS, tick `Access the directory as the signed-in user` and `Sign in and read user profile`. Click `Grant Permissions` (Note: you will need administrator privilege to grant permission).
* **Create a client secret key for the application**: Go to API ACCESS - Keys to create a secret key (`client-secret`).

### Include the package
[//]: # "{x-version-update-start;com.azure.spring:azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory;current}"
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-beta.1</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # "{x-version-update-end}"

## Key concepts
This package provides 2 ways to integrate with Spring Security and authenticate with Azure Active Directory.

The authorization flow is composed of 3 phrases:
* Login with credentials and validate id_token from Azure AD 
* Get On-Behalf-Of token and membership info from Azure AD Graph API
* Evaluate the permission based on membership info to grant or deny access

### Group membership
The way to get group relationship depends on the graph api used, the default to get membership is the direct group of the user. 
If you want to get all transitive relationships, the following are configuration item:

```properties
azure.activedirectory.graph-membership-uri=https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/transitiveMemberOf
``` 

### Web application
Based on Azure AD as a Web application, it uses OAuth2 authorization code flow to authentication, and authorizes resources based on the groups or roles claim in the access token. 
Provide a convenient way to quickly access other resource server, other resources should be registered as `ClientRegistration`, use `@RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient` annotation to mark the client resource, Spring Security will help automatically obtain valid access tokens based on the root refresh token, business methods will use the corresponding access token to request client resources.

#### Standalone web application usage
Only as a Web application, no further access to other resources protected by Azure AD.
![Standalone Web Application](resource/aad-based-standalone-web-application.png)

* Access restricted resources of web application, login with credentials using default scopes.
* Return secured data.

#### Web application access resources usage
Web application and resource server use scenarios, web application access the resources of resource server which is protected by Azure AD.
![Web Application Access Resources](resource/add-based-web-application-access-resources.png)

* Login with credentials, the scope includes all other clients. 
* Auto-acquire the access token of other clients based on the root refresh token.
* Use each client's access token to request restricted resource.
* Return secured data.

### Resource Server
Based on Azure AD as a Resource Server, it uses `BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter` authorize request. The current resource server also can access other resources, there's a similar method to the web application usage to obtain access to the client access token, the difference is the access token obtained based on the `MSAL On-Behalf-Of` process.

#### Standalone resource server usage
Only as a Resource Server, no further access to other resources protected by Azure AD.
![Standalone resource server usage](resource/add-based-standalone-resource-server.png)

* Access restricted resources of Resource Server.
* Validate access token.
* Return secured data.

#### Resource server access other resources usage
Resource server accesses other resource servers which are protected by Azure AD.
![Resource Server Access Other Resources](resource/add-based-resource-server-access-other-resources.png)

* Access restricted resources related to Graph and Custom resources through resource server.
* Auto On-Behalf-Of to request an access token for other clients.
* Use each client's access token to request restricted resource.
* Return secured data.

## Examples

Refer to different samples for different authentication ways. 

**Note**: `AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilter` and `AADAuthenticationFilter` will be deprecated. [Click here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/17860) to replace it.

### Authenticate in backend

Please refer to [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-backend](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-samples/azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-backend/README.md) for authenticate in backend. Or [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-backend-v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-samples/azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-backend-v2/README.md) to use Microsoft Graph API instead of Azure Active Directory Graph API.

####  Configure application.properties:
```properties
azure.activedirectory.tenant-id=xxxxxx-your-tenant-id-xxxxxx
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.azure.client-id=xxxxxx-your-client-id-xxxxxx
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.azure.client-secret=xxxxxx-your-client-secret-xxxxxx
azure.activedirectory.user-group.allowed-groups=group1, group2
```

#### If you want to create your own configuration class:
<!-- embedme ../azure-spring-boot/src/samples/java/com/azure/spring/aad/AADOAuth2LoginConfigSample.java#L18-L26 -->
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADOAuth2LoginConfigSample extends AzureOAuth2Configuration {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        super.configure(http);
    }
}
```

### Authenticate in frontend

Please refer to [azure-active-directory-spring-boot-sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-samples/azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-resource-server/README.md) for how to integrate Spring Security and Azure AD for authentication and authorization in a Single Page Application (SPA) scenario.

#### Configure application.properties:
```properties
azure.activedirectory.client-id=xxxxxx-your-client-id-xxxxxx
azure.activedirectory.client-secret=xxxxxx-your-client-secret-xxxxxx
azure.activedirectory.user-group.allowed-groups=Aad-groups e.g. group1,group2,group3
```

#### Autowire `AADAuthenticationFilter` in `WebSecurityConfig.java` file
<!-- embedme ../azure-spring-boot/src/samples/java/com/azure/spring/aad/AADAuthenticationFilterConfigSample.java#L18-L24 -->
```java
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true, prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADAuthenticationFilterConfigSample extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private AADAuthenticationFilter aadAuthFilter;

}
```

* Role-based Authorization with annotation `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('GROUP_NAME')")`
* Role-based Authorization with method `isMemberOf()`


### Authenticate stateless APIs using AAD app roles
This scenario fits best for stateless Spring backends exposing an API to SPAs ([OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow)) 
or service-to-service access using the [client credentials grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow).

The stateless processing can be activated with the `azure.activedirectory.session-stateless` property. 
The authorization is using the [AAD AppRole feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/multitenant-identity/app-roles#roles-using-azure-ad-app-roles),
so instead of using the `groups` claim the token has a `roles` claim which contains roles [configured in your manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps#examples). 

#### Configure your `application properties`:

```properties
azure.activedirectory.session-stateless=true
azure.activedirectory.client-id=xxxxxx-your-client-id-xxxxxx
```

#### Define your roles in your application registration manifest: 
```json
  "appRoles": [
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "User"
      ],
      "displayName": "My demo",
      "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "description": "My demo role.",
      "value": "MY_ROLE"
    }
  ],
```

#### Autowire the auth filter and attach it to the filter chain:
<!-- embedme ../azure-spring-boot/src/samples/java/com/azure/spring/aad/AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilterConfigSample.java#L22-L37 -->
```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilterConfigSample extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private AADAppRoleStatelessAuthenticationFilter appRoleAuthFilter;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
            .and()
            .addFilterBefore(appRoleAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    }

}
```

* Role-based Authorization with annotation `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('MY_ROLE')")`
* Role-based Authorization with method `isMemberOf()`

The roles you want to use within your application have to be [set up in the manifest of your
application registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps).

### Using The Microsoft Graph API
By default, azure-spring-boot is set up to utilize the Microsoft Graph. If you would prefer, it can be set up to utilize the Azure AD Graph instead.  In order to do this, you will need to update the app registration in Azure to grant the application permissions to the Azure AD Graph API and add some properties to the application.properties file.

* **Grant permissions to the application**: After application registration succeeded, go to API permissions - Add a permission, select `Azure Active Directory Graph`, select Delegated permissions,  tick `Directory.AccessAsUser.All - Access the directory as the signed-in user` and `Use.Read - Sign in and read user profile`. Click `Add Permissions` (Note: you will need administrator privilege to grant permission).  Furthermore, you can remove the API permissions to the Microsoft Graph, as these will not be needed.

* **Configure your `application properties`**:
```properties
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.azure.authorization-uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.azure.token-uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/token
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.azure.user-info-uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/openid/userinfo
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.azure.jwk-set-uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys
#
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.azure.scope=openid, https://graph.windows.net/user.read, {your-customized-scope}
```

If you're using [Azure China](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/china/china-welcome), please set the environment property in the `application.properties` file to:
```properties
azure.activedirectory.environment=cn-v2-graph
```

Please refer to [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-backend-v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-samples/azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-backend-v2/README.md) to see a sample configured to use the Microsoft Graph API.


### Customize scopes in authorize requests

By default, `azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory` configures scopes of `openid`, `profile` and `https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read` to implement OpenID Connect protocol and access of Microsoft Graph API. For customization of scope, developers need to configure in the `application.properties`:
```yaml
azure.activedirectory.authorization.azure.scopes = openid, profile, https://graph.microsoft.com/user.read, {your-customized-scope}
``` 
Note, if you don't configure the 3 mentioned permissions, this starter will add them automatically.

### Protect the Resource API through Resource Server
Please refer to [azure-spring-boot-sample-active-directory-spring-oauth2-resource-server][resource-server] for access resource api.

#### Include the package
```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
      <artifactId>azure-spring-boot-starter-active-directory</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-jose</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

#### Using `AADOAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfig` to extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`:

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class AADOAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests((requests) -> requests.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt()
            .jwtAuthenticationConverter(new AzureJwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter());
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
### Enable client logging
Azure SDKs for Java offers a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Enable Spring logging
Spring allow all the supported logging systems to set logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) by using `logging.level.<logger-name>=<level>` where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.

The following example shows potential logging settings in `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```

For more information about setting logging in spring, please refer to the [official doc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-logging).
