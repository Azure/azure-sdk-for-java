## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Environment checklist][environment_checklist]

### Include the package
1. [Add azure-spring-cloud-dependencies].
1. Add dependency. `<version>` can be skipped because we already add `azure-spring-cloud-dependencies`.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-spring-integration-eventhubs</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts
Spring Integration enables lightweight messaging within Spring-based applications and supports integration with external systems via declarative adapters. Those adapters provide a higher-level of abstraction over Spring’s support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling.

Note: RxJava support APIs have been deprecated from version 2.10.0, and will be dropped from version 4.0.0.
Please refer to Javadoc for details.
## Examples
Please refer to this [sample project][sample] illustrating how to use Event Hubs integration.

## Troubleshooting
### Logging setting
Please refer to [spring logging document] to get more information about logging.

#### Logging setting examples
- Example: Setting logging level of hibernate
```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```
