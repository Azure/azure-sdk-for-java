# Azure Event Hubs Kafka Spring cloud starter client library for Java
The Spring Cloud Stream Kafka binder for Azure Event Hubs helps developers to finish the auto-configuration of Event Hubs.  

[Package (Maven)][package] | [API reference documentation][refdocs] | [Product documentation][docs] | [Samples][sample]

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link] with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Maven][maven] 3.0 and above

### Include the package
[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure.spring:azure-spring-cloud-starter-eventhubs-kafka;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-spring-cloud-starter-eventhubs-kafka</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## Key concepts
Event Hubs provides a Kafka endpoint that can be used by your existing Kafka based applications as an alternative to running your own Kafka cluster. Event Hubs supports Apache Kafka protocol 1.0 and later, and works with your existing Kafka applications, including MirrorMaker.

## Examples
Please refer to this [sample project][sample] illustrating how to use this starter.

## Troubleshooting
### Enable client logging
Azure SDKs for Java offers a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Enable Spring logging
Spring allow all the supported logging systems to set logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) by using `logging.level.<logger-name>=<level>` where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.

The following example shows potential logging settings in `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```

For more information about setting logging in spring, please refer to the [official doc][logging_doc].
