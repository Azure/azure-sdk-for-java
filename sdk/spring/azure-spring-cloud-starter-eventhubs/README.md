## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Environment checklist][environment_checklist]

### Include the package
1. [Add azure-spring-cloud-dependencies].
1. Add dependency. `<version>` can be skipped because we already add `azure-spring-cloud-dependencies`.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-spring-cloud-starter-eventhubs</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts
Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

Note: RxJava support APIs have been deprecated from version 2.10.0, and will be dropped from version 4.0.0.
Please refer to Javadoc for details.
## Examples
Please refer to this [sample project][sample] illustrating how to use Spring Cloud Event Hubs.

## Troubleshooting
### Logging setting
Please refer to [spring logging document] to get more information about logging.

#### Logging setting examples
- Example: Setting logging level of hibernate
```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```
