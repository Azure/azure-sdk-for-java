# Spring Cloud Azure

Spring Cloud Azure offers a convenient way to interact with **Azure** provided services using well-known Spring idioms and APIs for Spring developers. 

 - [Reference doc](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/4.0.0-beta.3/4.0.0-beta.3/reference/html/index.html).
 - [Migration guide for 4.0](https://microsoft.github.io/spring-cloud-azure/4.0.0-beta.3/4.0.0-beta.3/reference/html/appendix.html#migration-guide-for-4-0).

## Build from Source

To check out the project and build it from source, do the following:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Azure/azure-sdk-for-java.git
cd azure-sdk-for-java
mvn clean package -f sdk/spring/pom.xml -P dev
```

And if you want to install jars into your local repository:

```shell
mvn clean install -f sdk/spring/pom.xml -P dev
```



## Modules

There're several modules in Spring Cloud Azure. Here is a quick review:

### spring-cloud-azure-autoconfigure

Auto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need. For example, if `Cosmos DB` is on the classpath, and the user has not configured any Cosmos DB clients, then they probably want an Cosmos DB client to be defined. Auto-configuration will always back away as the user starts to define their own beans. 

This module contains the auto-configuration code for Azure services. 

### spring-cloud-azure-starters

Spring Cloud Azure Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors to include in your application. It boosts your Spring Boot application developement with Azure services. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and Azure Cosmos DB for data persistence, include the `spring-cloud-azure-starter-cosmos` dependency in your project. 

The following application starters are provided by Spring Cloud Azure under the `com.azure.spring` group:

| Name                                                 | Description                                                  |

| spring-cloud-azure-starter-stream-servicebus         | Starter for using Azure Service Bus and Spring Cloud Stream Binder |


In addition to the application starters, the following starters can be used to add `production ready` features:

| Name                                | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| spring-cloud-azure-starter-actuator | Starter for using Spring Boot’s Actuator which provides production ready features to help you monitor and manage your application |

### spring-cloud-azure-actuator

Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application. `Spring Boot Actuator` provides the infrastructure required for actuator endpoints. 

This module extends the `Spring Boot Actuator` module and provides the actuating support for Azure servcies.

### spring-cloud-azure-actuator-autoconfigure

This provides auto-configuration for actuator endpoints based on the content of the classpath and a set of properties. 

### spring-integration-azure

Spring Integration Extension for Azure provides Spring Integration adapters for the various services provided by the [Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/). Below is a list of supported adapters:

- spring-integration-azure-eventhbus
- spring-integration-azure-servicebus
- spring-integration-azure-storage-queue

### spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

The framework provides a flexible programming model built on already established and familiar Spring idioms and best practices, including support for persistent pub/sub semantics, consumer groups, and stateful partitions.

Current binder implementations include:

- spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder-eventhubs
- spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder-servicebus

## Spring Cloud Azure Bill of Materials (BOM)

If you’re a Maven user, add our BOM to your pom.xml `<dependencyManagement>` section. This will allow you to not specify versions for any of the Maven dependencies and instead delegate versioning to the BOM.

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.0-beta.2</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
