# Azure Metrics Spring Boot Starter client library for Java

With this starter you could easily use Azure Metrics with Spring Boot.

[Package (Maven)][package] | [API reference documentation][refdocs]

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]
- [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 and above

### Include the package
[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.microsoft.azure:azure-spring-boot-metrics-starter;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-spring-boot-metrics-starter</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.3</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## Key concepts
**Java agent based monitoring**: Azure Application Insights has released one Java agent that can be used to capture metrics inside JVM. Consider use the Java agent based approach. 

Refer following document for more details:

https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent

## Examples
### Add the property setting

Open `application.properties` file and add below properties with your instrumentation key.

```
management.metrics.export.azuremonitor.instrumentation-key=<your-instrumentation-key-here>
```

## Troubleshooting
If the JDK version you use is greater than 1.8, You may meet this problem: 
```
NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBException
```

To solve this issue, you need to add the dependency below into your classpath:
```
<dependency>
   <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
   <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
   <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```
### Enable client logging
Azure SDKs for Java offer a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.

### Enable Spring logging
Spring allow all the supported logging systems to set logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) by using `logging.level.<logger-name>=<level>` where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.

The following example shows potential logging settings in `application.properties`:

```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```

For more information about setting loging in pring, please refer to the [official doc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-logging).
