            Azure Event Grid is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub Sub message
            distribution service. It can help build data pipelines with device data, integrate
            applications, and build event-driven serverless architectures. It enables
            clients to publish and subscribe to messages over the MQTT v3.1.1 and v5.0
            protocols to support Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Through HTTP, It
            enables you to build event-driven solutions where a publisher service announces
            its system state changes (events) to subscriber applications. It can be configured
            to send events to subscribers (push delivery) or subscribers can connect to
            Event Grid to read events (pull delivery). It supports CloudEvents 1.0 specification
            to provide interoperability across systems.

            Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the Redis software.
            Redis improves the performance and scalability of an application that uses backend
            data stores heavily. It's able to process large volumes of application requests by
            keeping frequently accessed data in the server memory, which can be written to and
            read from quickly. Redis brings a critical low-latency and high-throughput data
            storage solution to modern applications.

            up with the discovered compose.yml, create service connection beans for each
            supported container and call docker compose stop when the application is shutdown.
