## Troubleshooting

## Next steps

### Allow telemetry
Microsoft would like to collect data about how users use this Spring boot starter. Microsoft uses this information to improve our tooling experience. Participation is voluntary. If you don't want to participate, just simply disable it by setting below configuration in `application.properties`.
```
azure.servicebus.allow-telemetry=false
```
When telemetry is enabled, an HTTP request will be sent to URL `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/v2/track`. So please make sure it's not blocked by your firewall.
