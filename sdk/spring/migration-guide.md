# Guide for migrating to Spring Cloud Azure 4.0



This guide assists in the migration to **Spring Cloud Azure 4.0** from legacy Azure Spring libraries. We will call libraries whose group id and artifact id following pattern `com.azure.spring:spring-cloud-azure-*` the morden libraries, and those with pattern `com.azure.spring:azure-spring-boot-*`, `com.azure.spring:azure-spring-cloud-*` , or `com.azure.spring:azure-spring-integration-*` the legacy ones. This guide will focus the side-by-side comparisons for similar configurations between the morden and legacy libraries. o

Familiarity with `com.azure.spring:azure-spring-boot-*`, `com.azure.spring:azure-spring-cloud-*` or `com.azure.spring:azure-spring-integration-*` package is assumed. For those new to the Spring Cloud Azure 4.0 libraries, please refer to the REAME.md**[placeholder]** rather than this guide.

## Migration benefits

A natural question to ask when considering whether or not to adopt a new version or libary is its benefits. As Azure has matured and been embraced by a more diverse group of developers, we have been focused on learning the patterns and practices to best support developer productivity and to understand the gaps that the Spring Cloud Azure libraries have.

There were several areas of consistent feedback expressed across the Spring Cloud Azure libraries. The most important is that the libraries for different Azure services have not enabled the complete set of configurations. Additionally, the inconsistency of project naming, artifact ids, versions, configurations made the learning curve steep. 

To improve the development experience across Spring Cloud Azure libraries, a set of design guidelines was introduced to ensure that Spring Cloud Azure libraries have a natural and idiomatic feel with respect to the Spring ecosystem. Further details are available in the guidelines**[placeholder]** for those interested. 

The **Spring Cloud Azure 4.0** provides the shared experience across libraries integrating with different Spring projects, for example Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream, etc. The shared experience includes:

- **[placeholder]** An official name for the project?

- A unified BOM to include all Spring Cloud Azure 4.0 libraries.
- A consitent naming convention for artifacts.
- A unified way to configure credential, proxy, retry, cloud environment, and transport layer settings.

- Supporting all the authenticating methods an Azure Service or Azure Service SDK supports.

## Overview

This migration guide will be consisted of below sections:

- Naming changes for Spring Cloud Azure 4.0
- Artifcats changes: renamed / added / deleted 

- Configuration properties
- Authentication 

## Naming changes

There has never been a consistent or official name to call all the Spring Cloud Azure libraries, some of them were called `Azure Spring Boot` and some of them ` Spring on Azure` , and all these names will make developer confused. Since 4.0, we began to use the project name `Spring Cloud Azure` to represent all the Azure Spring libraries. 

## BOM

We used to ship two BOMs for our libaries, the `azure-spring-boot-bom` and `azure-spring-cloud-dependencies`, but we combined these two BOMs into one BOM since 4.0, the `spring-cloud-azure-dependencies`. Please add an entry in the dependencyManagement of your project to benefit from the dependency management.

```xml
<properties>
  <spring.cloud.azure.version>4.0.0</spring.cloud.azure.version>
</properties>
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
          <version>${spring.cloud.azure.version}</version>
          <type>pom</type>
          <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
```



## Artifacts changes: renamed / added / deleted

Group ids are the same for morden and legacy Spring Cloud Azure libraries, they are all `com.azure.spring`. Artifact ids for the morden Spring Cloud Azure libraries have changed. And according to which Spring project it belongs, Spring Boot, Spring Integration or Spring Cloud Stream, the artifact ids pattern could be `spring-cloud-azure-starter-[service]`, `spring-integration-azure-[service]` and `spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder-[service]`. The legacy starters each has an artifact id following the pattern `azure-spring-*`. This provides a quick and accessible means to help understand, at a glance, whether you are using morden or legacy starters.

In the process of developing Spring Cloud Azure 4.0, we renamed some artifacts to make them follow the new naming convention, deleted some artifcats for its functionality could be put in a more appropriate artifact, and added some new artifacts to better serve some scenarios.

## Dependencies changes
Some unnecesary dependecies were included in the legacy artifacts, which we have removed in the morden Spring Cloud Azure 4.0 libaries. Please make sure add the removed dependencies munally to your project to prevent unintentionally crash.

## Configuration properties

### Global configurations

The morden `spring-cloud-azure-starter` allows developers to define properties that apply to all Azure SDKs in the namespace `spring.cloud.azure`. It was not supported in the legacy `azure-spring-boot-starter`. The global configurations can be divided into five categories:

| Prefix                        | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| spring.cloud.azure.client     | To configure the transport clients underneath each Azure SDK. |
| spring.cloud.azure.credential | To configure how to authenticate with Azure Active Directory. |
| spring.cloud.azure.profile    | To configure the Azure cloud environment.                    |
| spring.cloud.azure.proxy      | To configure the proxy options apply to all Azure SDK clients. |
| spring.cloud.azure.retry      | To configure the retry options apply to all Azure SDK clients. |

For a full list of common configurations, check this list **[placeholder]**.



### Each SDK configurations



## API breaking changes



## Authentication

Spring Cloud Azure 4.0 supports all the authentication methods each Azure Service SDK supports. It allows to configure a global token credential as well as providing the token credential at each service level. But credential is not required to configure in Spring Cloud Azure 4.0, it can leverage the credential stored in local developing environment, or managed identiy in Azure Services, just make sure the principal has been granted sufficient permission to acess the target Azure resources.
