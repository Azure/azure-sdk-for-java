# Azure Spring Boot Key Vault Certificates client library for Java

## Key concepts
This sample illustrates how to use [Azure Spring Boot Starter Key Vault Certificates ](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-starter-keyvault-certificates/README.md).

In this sample, a certificate named `self-signed` is stored into an Azure Key Vault, and a sample Spring application will use its value as a configuration property value.
