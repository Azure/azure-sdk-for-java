# Azure Spring Boot Key Vault Certificates client library for Java

## Key concepts
This sample illustrates how to use [Azure Spring Boot Starter Key Vault Certificates ][azure_spring_boot_starter_key_vault_certificates].

In this sample, a certificate named `self-signed` is stored into an Azure Key Vault, and a sample Spring application will use its value as a configuration property value.

This sample can work together with [azure-spring-boot-sample-keyvault-certificates-client-side].

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Environment checklist][environment_checklist]

### Store Certificate
We need to store certificate `self-signed` into Azure Key Vault with the following steps: [store certificate ][steps_to_store_certificate]

### Config the sample
Fulfill these properties in application.yml:
```yaml
azure:
  keyvault:
    uri:                 # The URI to the Azure Key Vault used
    tenant-id:           # The Tenant ID for your Azure Key Vault (needed if you are not using managed identity).
    client-id:           # The Client ID that has been setup with access to your Azure Key Vault (needed if you are not using managed identity).
    client-secret:       # The Client Secret that will be used for accessing your Azure Key Vault (needed if you are not using managed identity).
```

### How to run
1. Start SampleApplication
1. Access https://localhost:8443/

Then you will get
```text
Hello World
```
