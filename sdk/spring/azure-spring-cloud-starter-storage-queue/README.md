## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Environment checklist][environment_checklist]

### Include the package
1. [Add azure-spring-cloud-dependencies].
1. Add dependency. `<version>` can be skipped because we already add `azure-spring-cloud-dependencies`.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-spring-cloud-starter-storage-queue</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Key concepts

Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. You access messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.

## Examples
Please refer to this [sample project][sample] illustrating how to use Spring cloud Starter Storage Queue.

## Troubleshooting
### Logging setting
Please refer to [spring logging document] to get more information about logging.

#### Logging setting examples
- Example: Setting logging level of hibernate
```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.hibernate=ERROR
```

## Next steps

The following section provides sample projects illustrating how to use the starter in different cases.
