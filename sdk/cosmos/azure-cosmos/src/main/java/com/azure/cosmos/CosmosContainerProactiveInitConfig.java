     * to performing any workload on the container. This way the latency associated with opening connections
     * does not impact the latency associated with performing workloads on the container. These connections are
     * opened synchronously when the {@link CosmosClient}/{@link CosmosAsyncClient} is built.

     * These proactive connection regions are a subset of the preferred regions configured through the {@link CosmosClientBuilder}. The first
     * {@link CosmosContainerProactiveInitConfig#getProactiveConnectionRegionsCount()} read regions from preferred regions are picked. In this context a write-region could also be a read-region but not vice-versa.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Consider a multi-master account with client configured with preferred regions - "US West" (write-region) and "US East" (write-region)
     * <br>
     * 1. If the no. of proactive regions is set to two, connections to "US West" and "US East" are opened proactively.
     * <br>
     * 2. If the no. of proactive regions is set to one, connections to "US West" are opened proactively.
     * <br><br>
     * Consider a single-master account with client configured with preferred regions - "US West" (read-region), "US East" (read-region) and
     * "West Europe" (write-region)
     * <br>
     * 1. If the no. of proactive regions is set to two, connections to "US West" and "US East" are opened proactively. If your application
