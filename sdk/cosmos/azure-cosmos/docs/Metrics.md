# Cosmos DB client-side metrics

The Cosmos DB SDK for Java allows enabling micrometer.io metrics to track latency, request charge (RU/s), request rates etc. for logical operations (API calls into the SDK from your application/service) as well as actual requests to the Cosmos DB service (for example when due to Consistency level Strong or Bounded Staleness requests need to be sent to multiple replica). These metrics are tagged with different dimensions - so it is possible to look at metrics like latency, request charge etc. for a certain dimension like operation type, response status code etc.

**<u>Please note:</u> There is some performance overhead when enabling metrics due to increased CPU usage. The overhead is small (<10%) but should be tested before enabling it in production especially for large containers/workloads (> 5 TB of data or > 1,000,000 RU/s)** 

## How to enable metrics?

To enable client metrics a `io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry` needs to be passed to the `CosmosClientBuilder` when creating the singleton Cosmos client.

```java
CosmosClientTelemetryConfig telemetryConfig = new CosmosClientTelemetryConfig()
    .metricsOptions(new CosmosMicrometerMetricsOptions().meterRegistry(createConsoleLoggingMeterRegistry()));

this.client = new CosmosClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("<Endpint>")
    .key("<Key>")
    .clientTelemetryConfig(telemetryConfig)
    .buildClient();
```

A sample for a `MeterRegistry` simply logging to the Console can be create like this:

```java
private static MeterRegistry createConsoleLoggingMeterRegistry() {

    final MetricRegistry dropwizardRegistry = new MetricRegistry();

    final ConsoleReporter consoleReporter = ConsoleReporter
        .forRegistry(dropwizardRegistry)
        .convertRatesTo(TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .convertDurationsTo(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
        .build();

    consoleReporter.start(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    DropwizardConfig dropwizardConfig = new DropwizardConfig() {

        @Override
        public String get(@Nullable String key) {
            return null;
        }

        @Override
        public String prefix() {
            return "console";
        }

    };

    final DropwizardMeterRegistry consoleLoggingRegistry = new DropwizardMeterRegistry(
        dropwizardConfig, dropwizardRegistry, HierarchicalNameMapper.DEFAULT, Clock.SYSTEM) {
        @Override
        protected Double nullGaugeValue() {
            return Double.NaN;
        }

        @Override
        public void close() {
            super.close();
            consoleReporter.stop();
            consoleReporter.close();
        }
    };

    consoleLoggingRegistry.config().namingConvention(NamingConvention.dot);
    return consoleLoggingRegistry;
}
```

The micrometer.io documentation has a list with samples on how to create a `MeterRegistry` for several telemetry systems: `https://micrometer.io/docs`. You can also find an implementation via an Azure Monitor `MeterRegistry` here: [Spark sample with Azure Monitor `MeterRegistry`](https://aka.ms/azure-cosmos-spark_CosmosMetricsApplicationInsightsPlugin)

### Request timeline stages

Metrics are available for other stages in the request pipeline as well - but the following stages will be of special interest for monitoring applications:

- channelAcquisitionStarted: Higher values indicate that no channel (TCP connection) is available and a new one needs to be created - either because there is no open connection for the requested replica or because the number of concurrent requests is so high that another connection is needeed
- transitTime: This is the duration between first byte sent and last byte received - so the time spent in the backend for processing the request + the network turnaround-time. High value with high variance to the backend-reported latency usually indicate either network problems or some resource constraint on the client (or network component like SNAT ports)
- pipelined: is the time the requests waits because too many concurrent requests are being processed on a channel (TCP connection). Constantly high values here would indicate that the capacity of the application/service isn't sufficient and would need to be scaled-out.
- The other pipeline stages are not expected to have regularly high values - any high values usually would indicate either some thread-pool issue on the client or client overload. Best way to double check usually is looking whether high values happen on only single (few) client machines or all of them - and what the CPU utilization (max) is at the time in question.
