/**
 * Simple host for distributing change feed events across observers and thus allowing these observers scale.
 * It distributes the load across its instances and allows dynamic scaling:
 *   - Partitions in partitioned collections are distributed across instances/observers.
 *   - New instance takes leases from existing instances to make distribution equal.
 *   - If an instance dies, the leases are distributed across remaining instances.
 * It's useful for scenario when partition count is high so that one host/VM is not capable of processing that many change feed events.
 * Client application needs to implement {@link ChangeFeedObserver} and register processor implementation with {@link ChangeFeedProcessor}.
 * <p>
 * It uses auxiliary document collection for managing leases for a partition.
 * Every EventProcessorHost instance is performing the following two tasks:
 *     1) Renew Leases: It keeps track of leases currently owned by the host and continuously keeps on renewing the leases.
 *     2) Acquire Leases: Each instance continuously polls all leases to check if there are any leases it should acquire
 *     for the system to get into balanced state.
 * <p>

 *         // Implementation for handling and processing CosmosItemProperties list goes here
