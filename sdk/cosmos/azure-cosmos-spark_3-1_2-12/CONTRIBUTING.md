# Contributing
This instruction is guideline for building and code contribution.

## Prequisites
- JDK 11 and above
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 and above

## Build from source
To build the project, run maven commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java.git 
cd sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos-spark_3_2.12
mvnw clean install
```

## Test
There are integration tests on azure and on emulator to trigger integration test execution
against Azure Cosmos DB and against 
[Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator), you need to 
follow the link to set up emulator before test execution.

- Run unit tests
```bash
mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip
```

- Run integration tests
   - on Azure 
     >**NOTE** Please note that integration test against Azure requires Azure Cosmos DB Document 
     >API and will automatically create a Cosmos database in your Azure subscription, then there 
     >will be **Azure usage fee.**
 
     Integration tests will require a Azure Subscription. If you don't already have an Azure 
     subscription, you can activate your
      [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) 
      or sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
  
     1. Create an Azure Cosmos DB on Azure.
        - Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and click +New.
        - Click Databases, and then click Azure Cosmos DB to create your database. 
        - Navigate to the database you have created, and click Access keys and copy your 
        URI and access keys for your database.
  
     2. Set environment variables ACCOUNT_HOST, ACCOUNT_KEY and SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_KEY, where value 
     of them are Cosmos account URI, primary key and secondary key. 
     
        So set the 
        second group environment variables NEW_ACCOUNT_HOST, NEW_ACCOUNT_KEY and 
        NEW_SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_KEY, the two group environment variables can be same.
     3. Run maven command with `integration-test-azure` profile. 
  
        ```bash
        set ACCOUNT_HOST=your-cosmos-account-uri
        set ACCOUNT_KEY=your-cosmos-account-primary-key
        set SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_KEY=your-cosmos-account-secondary-key
        
        set NEW_ACCOUNT_HOST=your-cosmos-account-uri
        set NEW_ACCOUNT_KEY=your-cosmos-account-primary-key
        set NEW_SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_KEY=your-cosmos-account-secondary-key
        mvnw -P integration-test-azure clean install
        ```
        
   - on Emulator
   
     Setup Azure Cosmos DB Emulator by following 
     [this instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator), and set 
     associated environment variables. Then run test with:
     ```bash
     mvnw -P integration-test-emulator install
     ```


- Skip tests execution
```bash
mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip-DskipTests
```
