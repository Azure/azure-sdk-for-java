- Java Development Kit 11
- An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free account][azure_subscription].
  Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator][local_emulator] for development and testing.

  [explained here][local_emulator_export_ssl_certificates]
- (Optional) SLF4J is a logging facade.
- (Optional) [SLF4J binding](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) is used to associate a
  specific logging framework with SLF4J.
- (Optional) Maven

SLF4J is only needed if you plan to use logging, please also download an SLF4J binding which will
link the SLF4J API with the logging implementation of your choice. See
the [SLF4J user manual](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) for more information.
