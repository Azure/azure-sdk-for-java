### 4.21.0 (2023-08-09)

#### Features Added
* Spark 3.4 support: - See [PR 35176](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35176).
* Added a new configuration setting `spark.cosmos.write.bulk.initialBatchSize` to allow specifying the initial micro batch size for bulk operations. The batch size will be tuned automatically based on the throttling rate afterwards - by default it starts initially with 100 documents per batch. This can lead to exceeding the requested throughput when using throughput control in the first few seconds of a Spark job. This usually isn't a problem - but if there is the desire to avoid this, reducing the initial micro batch size - for example setting it to `1` - would avoid the initial spike in RU/s usage. - See [PR 36068](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/36068)
* Added new strategy `ItemBulkUpdate` to allow patch with more than 10 columns - See [PR 35977](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35977)

#### Bugs Fixed
* Fixed schema reference issue for empty array - See [PR 35746](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35746)
