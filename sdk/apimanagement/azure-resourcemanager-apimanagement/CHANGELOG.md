## 1.0.0-beta.5 (2024-12-03)

- Azure Resource Manager ApiManagement client library for Java. This package contains Microsoft Azure SDK for ApiManagement Management SDK. ApiManagement Client. Package tag package-2022-08.

### Breaking Changes

#### Serialization/Deserialization change

- `Jackson` is removed from dependency and no longer supported.

##### Migration Guide

If you are using `Jackson`/`ObjectMapper` for manual serialization/deserialization, configure your `ObjectMapper` for backward compatibility:
```java
objectMapper.registerModule(com.azure.core.serializer.json.jackson.JacksonJsonProvider.getJsonSerializableDatabindModule());
```
