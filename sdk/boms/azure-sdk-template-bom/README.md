# Azure BOM for testing the release pipeline
This is just a BOM which was created for the purposes of testing the bom release pipeline.
This BOM should not be used by anyone as it provides absolutely nothing. The only entry in
this BOM file will be azure-sdk-template which is our library used for testing the release
pipeline for libraries.
