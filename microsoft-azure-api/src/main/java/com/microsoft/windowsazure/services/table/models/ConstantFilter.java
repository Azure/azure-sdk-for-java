/**
 * Represents a constant value used as a filter parameter in a table query request.

 * Use the static factory method in the {@link Filter} class to create a {@link ConstantFilter}, rather than
 * constructing one directly.
 * <p>
 * Use this class to pass a constant value as a filter parameter. The value is passed as an <code>Object</code> but must
 * be (or have an implicit conversion to) one of the following for successful serialization:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>null</code></li>
 * <li><code>byte[]</code></li>
 * <li><code>Byte[]</code></li>
 * <li><code>Date</code></li>
 * <li><code>Long</code></li>
 * <li><code>String</code></li>
 * <li><code>UUID</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A {@link PropertyNameFilter} may be combined in a {@link BinaryFilter} with a comparison operator and a
 * {@link ConstantFilter} to limit query results to properties with values that match the {@link ConstantFilter} value.
 * The table service does not support wildcard queries, but you can perform prefix matching by using comparison
 * operators on the desired prefix created as a {@link String} in a {@link ConstantFilter} instance.
 * <p>
 * See the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd894031.aspx">Querying Tables and Entities</a>
 * topic in MSDN for more information on creating table query filter strings.
