/**
 * Represents a property name used as a filter parameter in a table query request.
 * <p>
 * Use the static factory method in the {@link Filter} class to create a {@link PropertyNameFilter}, rather than
 * constructing one directly.
 * <p>
 * Use this class to pass a property name as a filter parameter. When the filter is evaluated, the content of the named
 * property in the entity is used in the filter expression.
 * <p>
 * Note that case is significant for the <strong>PartitionKey</strong> and <strong>RowKey</strong> property names in a
 * filter.
 * <p>
 * A {@link PropertyNameFilter} may be combined in a {@link BinaryFilter} with a comparison operator and a
 * {@link ConstantFilter} to limit query results to properties with values that match the {@link ConstantFilter} value.
 * The table service does not support wildcard queries, but you can perform prefix matching by using comparison
 * operators on the desired prefix created as a {@link String} in a {@link ConstantFilter} instance.
 * <p>
 * See the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd894031.aspx">Querying Tables and Entities</a>
