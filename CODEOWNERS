#
# CODEOWNERS is a GitHub standard to specify who is automatically assigned pull requests to review. 
# This helps to prevent pull requests from languishing without review.
# GitHub can also be configured to require review from code owners before a pull request can be merged.
#
# Further reading is available from the following two URLs:
#   https://blog.github.com/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/
#   https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/  
#
# It uses the same pattern rule for gitignore file

#

# Any pull request containing changes of files inside a 'data-plane' or 'client' directory will be reviewed 
# by the azure-java-client-sdk-team.
# Because there is a restructure coming up, and because 'client' is an overloaded term, there is a single
# wildcard star being used, so we only match one directory, not many.
