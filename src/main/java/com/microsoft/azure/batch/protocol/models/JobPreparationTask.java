/**
 * A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any given
 * compute node.
 * You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the
 * job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading
 * common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation
 * task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the
 * compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service
 * on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it.
 * If the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before
 * exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the
 * compute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it
 * is reimaged. The node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The Job
 * Preparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore,
 * you should write the Job Preparation task to handle re-execution. If the
 * compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the node
 * before scheduling any other task of the job, if
 * rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did not
 * previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job Preparation
 * task is run again before scheduling any task of the job. Batch will retry
 * tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
 * compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure.
 * Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
 * against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an
 * internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all
 * tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.
