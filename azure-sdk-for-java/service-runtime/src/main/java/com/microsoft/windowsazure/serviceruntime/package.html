<!--
The contents contained in the body of this file (package.html) are automatically picked up by the Javadoc compiler
to include package-level material in the Javadoc output. For this file to be picked up by Javadoc, the file must be
in the same folder as the *.java items for the package.

Additionally, it appears the Javadoc command must be executed at the parent folder of 'com\microsoft\windowsazure\<packagename>', in order
for the contents of this file to be contained in the Javadoc output. So each package should have its own package.html file, and if
placed in the proper location, Javadoc will pick up the html body contents automatically. If Javadoc doesn't find package.html
in the proper location, a blank description for the package will appear in the doc output.
