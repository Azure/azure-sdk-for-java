     * Vault in a protected form. Note that this operation does not return key material in a form that can be used outside the Azure Key
     * Vault system, the returned key material is either protected to a Azure Key Vault HSM or to Azure Key Vault itself. The intent
     * of this operation is to allow a client to generate a key in one Azure Key Vault instance, backup the key, and then restore it
     * into another Azure Key Vault instance. The backup operation may be used to export, in protected form, any key type from Azure
     * Key Vault. Individual versions of a key cannot be backed up. Backup / Restore can be performed within geographical boundaries only;
     * meaning that a backup from one geographical area cannot be restored to another geographical area. For example, a backup
     * from the US geographical area cannot be restored in an EU geographical area. This operation requires the {@code key/backup} permission.
