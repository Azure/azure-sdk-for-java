     * Create a new host instance to process events from an Event Hub.
     * <p>
     * Since Event Hubs are generally used for scale-out, high-traffic scenarios, in most scenarios there will
     * be only one host instances per process, and the processes will be run on separate machines. Besides scale, this also
     * provides isolation: one process or machine crashing will not take out multiple host instances. However, it is
     * supported to run multiple host instances on one machine, or even within one process, for development and testing.
     * <p>
     * The hostName parameter is a name for this event processor host, which must be unique among all event processor host instances
     * receiving from this event hub+consumer group combination: the unique name is used to distinguish which event processor host
     * instance owns the lease for a given partition. An easy way to generate a unique hostName which also includes
     * other information is to call EventProcessorHost.createHostName("mystring").
     * <p>
     * This overload of the constructor uses the built-in lease and checkpoint managers. The
     * Azure Storage account specified by the storageConnectionString parameter is used by the built-in
     * managers to record leases and checkpoints, in the specified container.
     * <p>
     * The Event Hub connection string may be conveniently constructed using the ConnectionStringBuilder class
     * from the Java Event Hub client.
     *
     * @param hostName                 A name for this event processor host. See method notes.
