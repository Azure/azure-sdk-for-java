 * Interface that must be implemented by event processor classes.

 * Any given instance of an event processor class will only process events from one partition
 * of one Event Hub. A PartitionContext is provided with each call to the event processor because
 * some parameters could change, but it will always be the same partition.
 * <p>
 * Although EventProcessorHost is multithreaded, calls to a given instance of an event processor
 * class are serialized, except for onError(). onOpen() is called first, then onEvents() will be called zero or more
 * times. When the event processor needs to be shut down, whether because there was a failure
 * somewhere, or the lease for the partition has been lost, or because the entire processor host
 * is being shut down, onClose() is called after the last onEvents() call returns.
 * <p>
 * onError() could be called while onEvents() or onClose() is executing. No synchronization is attempted
 * in order to avoid possibly deadlocking.
