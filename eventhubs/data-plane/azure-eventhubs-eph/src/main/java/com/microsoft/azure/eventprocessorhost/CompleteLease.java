/**
 * CompleteLease class is public so that advanced users can implement an ILeaseManager.
 * Unless you are implementing ILeaseManager you should not have to deal with objects
 * of this class or derived classes directly.
 * <p>
 * CompleteLease carries around complete information about a lease. By itself, it has the
 * epoch. Any lease manager implementation can derive from this class to add data which
 * the lease manager needs to function -- see AzureBlobLease for an example. Having two
 * distinct classes allows the code to clearly express which variety of lease any variable
 * holds or a method requires, and avoids the problem of accidentally supplying a lightweight
 * BaseLease to a method which needs the lease-manager-specific fields.
