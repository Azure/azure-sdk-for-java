/**
 * This class offers API that simplifies the task of executing long-running operations against Azure service.
 * The {@link Poller} consist of poll operation, cancel operation if supported by Azure service and polling interval.
 * <p>
  * It provides the following functionality:
 *
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Querying the current state of long-running operations.</li>
 *      <li>Requesting an asynchronous notification for long-running operation's state.</li>
 *      <li>Cancelling the long-running operation if cancellation is supported by the service.</li>
 *      <li>Triggering a poll operation manually.</li>
 *      <li>Enable/Disable auto-polling.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Auto Polling</strong></p>
 * Auto-polling is enabled by-default. It means that the {@link Poller} starts polling as soon as its instance is created. The {@link Poller} will transparently call the poll operation every polling cycle
 * and track the state of the long-running operation. Azure services can return {@link PollResponse#getRetryAfter()} to override the {@code Poller.pollInterval} defined in the {@link Poller}.
 * The {@link Poller#getStatus()} represents the status returned by the successful long-running operation at the time the last auto-polling or last manual polling, whichever happened most recently.
 *
 *<p><strong>Disable Auto Polling</strong></p>
 * For those scenarios which require manual control of the polling cycle, disable auto-poling by calling {@code setAutoPollingEnabled#false} and perform manual poll
 * by invoking {@link Poller#poll()} function. It will call poll operation once and update the {@link Poller} with the latest status.
 * <p>When auto-polling is disabled, the {@link Poller} will not update its status or other information, unless manual polling is triggered by calling {@link Poller#poll()} function.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Poller} will stop polling when the long-running operation is complete or it is disabled. The polling is considered complete
 * based on status defined in {@link OperationStatus}.
