/**
 * This package contains the implementation classes for BingVisualSearchAPI.
 * The Image Visual Search API lets you send an image to Bing and get back a list of relevant tags. Each tag contains potential actions a user might be interested in. This section provides technical details about the request format and headers that you use to request actions and the JSON response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web for Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
