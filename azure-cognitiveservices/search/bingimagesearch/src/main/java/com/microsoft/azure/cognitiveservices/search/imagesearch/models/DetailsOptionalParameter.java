    * Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features
    * and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the
    * same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights.
    * Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
    * request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the
    * client ID to tailor web results to that client IDâ€™s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
    * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
    * improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates
    * for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID
    * across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
    * consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
    * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
    * header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that
    * you should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client
    * ID for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
    * in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session
    * cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
    * user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
    * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing requests for the

    * Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features
    * and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the
    * same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights.
    * Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
    * request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the
    * client ID to tailor web results to that client IDâ€™s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing
    * also uses this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
    * improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates
    * for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client ID
    * across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
    * consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each
    * user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
    * header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that
    * you should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client
    * ID for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
    * in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session
    * cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
    * user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
    * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing requests for the
    * user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
