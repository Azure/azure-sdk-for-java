## Development Process
The development process used by Microsoft is an agile process. An agile process is an iterative and incremental model that it is characterized to work into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design. The idea is to have an available release with the minimum bugs at the end of each iteration.

An alternative model that could be use in Azure Software Development is the RAD model. Rapid Application Development model is an incremental software process model that focuses on short development cycle time. This model is a “high-speed” model which adapts many steps from waterfall model in which rapid development is achieved by using component based construction approach.

This would be a perfect fit for Azure since the basic requirements for implementing this model are probably answered in Azure:

* Sufficient human resources to create the right number of RAD teams
* Developers and customers must be committed to the rapid , rapid-fire activities necessary to complete the system in a much abbreviated time frame.
* Project should be properly modularize.
* Besides this model brings a lot of advantages that are very useful along the development of Azure:
* Flexible and adaptable to changes.
* Prototyping applications gives users a tangible description from which to judge whether critical system requirements are being met by the system. Report output can be compared with existing reports. Data entry forms can be reviewed for completeness of all fields, navigation, data access (drop down lists,checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.).
* RAD generally incorporates short development cycles – users see the RAD product quickly.
* RAD involves user participation thereby increasing chances of early user community acceptance.
* RAD realizes an overall reduction in project risk.
