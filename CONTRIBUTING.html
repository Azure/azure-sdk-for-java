</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO</strong> submit all code changes via pull requests (PRs) rather than through a direct commit. PRs will be reviewed and potentially merged by the repo maintainers after a peer review that includes at least one maintainer.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> submit &quot;work in progress&quot; PRs.  A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review and subsequent merging by the contributor.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> give PRs short-but-descriptive names (e.g. &quot;Improve code coverage for Azure.Core by 10%&quot;, not &quot;Fix #1234&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> refer to any relevant issues, and include <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/">keywords</a> that automatically close issues when the PR is merged.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> tag any users that should know about and/or review the change.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> ensure each commit successfully builds.  The entire PR must pass all tests in the Continuous Integration (CI) system before it'll be merged.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> address PR feedback in an additional commit(s) rather than amending the existing commits, and only rebase/squash them when necessary.  This makes it easier for reviewers to track changes.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> assume that <a href="https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits">&quot;Squash and Merge&quot;</a> will be used to merge your commit unless you request otherwise in the PR.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> fix merge conflicts using a merge commit. Prefer <code>git rebase</code>.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> mix independent, unrelated changes in one PR. Separate real product/test code changes from larger code formatting/dead code removal changes. Separate unrelated fixes into separate PRs, especially if they are in different assemblies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="merging-pull-requests-for-project-contributors-with-write-access">Merging Pull Requests (for project contributors with write access)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DO</strong> use <a href="https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits">&quot;Squash and Merge&quot;</a> by default for individual contributions unless requested by the PR author.
Do so, even if the PR contains only one commit. It creates a simpler history than &quot;Create a Merge Commit&quot;.
Reasons that PR authors may request &quot;Merge and Commit&quot; may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>The change is easier to understand as a series of focused commits. Each commit in the series must be buildable so as not to break <code>git bisect</code>.</li>
<li>Contributor is using an e-mail address other than the primary GitHub address and wants that preserved in the history. Contributor must be willing to squash
the commits manually before acceptance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="building-and-unit-testing">Building and Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Building">build wiki</a> for learning how to build Java SDKs
and the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Unit-Testing">unit testing wiki</a> for guidelines on unit
testing.</p>
<h3 id="live-testing">Live testing</h3>
<p>Live tests assume a live resource has been created and appropriate environment
variables have been set for the test process. To automate setting up live
resources we use created a script called <code>New-TestResources.ps1</code> that deploys
resources for a given service.</p>
<p>To see what resources will be deployed for a live service, check the
<code>test-resources.json</code> ARM template files in the service you wish to deploy for
testing, for example <code>sdk\keyvault\test-resources.json</code>.</p>
<p>To deploy live resources for testing use the steps documented in <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/eng/common/TestResources/New-TestResources.ps1.md#example-1"><code>Example 1 of New-TestResources.ps1</code></a>
to set up a service principal and deploy live testing resources.</p>
<p>The script will provide instructions for setting environment variables before
running live tests.</p>
<p>To run live tests against a service after deploying live resources:</p>
<pre><code>mvn -f sdk/keyvault/pom.xml -Dmaven.wagon.http.pool=false --batch-mode --fail-at-end --settings eng/settings.xml test
</code></pre>
<p>Some live tests may have additional steps for setting up live testing resources.
See the CONTRIBUTING.md file for the service you wish to test for additional
information or instructions.</p>
<h2 id="versions-and-versioning">Versions and versioning</h2>
<p>Tooling has been introduced to centralize versioning and help ease the pain of updating artifact versions in POM and README files. Under the eng\versioning directory there exists a version text file for libraries (<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/eng/versioning/version_client.txt">version_client.txt</a>).
The format of the version files is as follows:</p>
<p><code>groupId:artifactId;dependency-version;current-version</code></p>
<p>The dependency-version should be set to the most recent released version and the current-version is set to the next version to be released. For example:</p>
<p><code>com.azure:azure-identity;1.0.0-beta.4;1.0.0-beta.5</code></p>
<p>Note: In the case of a new artifact both versions will be the same. In the case of a released artifact, the dependency version should be the latest released version.</p>
<h3 id="supported-groupids-and-publishing">Supported GroupIds and publishing</h3>
<p>We no longer publish directly to Maven Central, any publishing is done through ESRP. Libraries published need to conform to one of the groupIds that we can publish to. Here is the list of accepted groupIds:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.azure.*&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.azure&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.azure&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.azure.functions&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.azure.kusto&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.provisioning&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.commondatamodel&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.windowsazure&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.sqlserver&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.spring&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.servicefabric&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;com.microsoft.rest&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;io.clientcore&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This list will be replaced with a link to a page created by ESRP providing a UI where GroupIds can be checked and new ones requested if needed.</p>
<h3 id="libraries-vs-external-dependencies">Libraries vs External Dependencies</h3>
<p>Libraries refer to things that are built and released as part of the Azure SDK. Libraries have a current version and a dependency version.</p>
<p>External Dependencies refer to dependencies for things that are not built and released as part of the Azure SDK regardless of the source. External Dependencies will only ever have a dependency version.</p>
<h3 id="current-version-dependency-version-unreleased-dependency-version-and-released-beta-dependency-version">Current version, Dependency version, Unreleased Dependency version and Released Beta Dependency version</h3>
<p><strong>Current version</strong> - This is the version we should be using when defining a component in its POM file and also when dependent components are built within the same pipeline. The current version is the version currently in development.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency version</strong> - This is the version we should be using when a given library is a dependency outside a particular area. This should be the latest released version of the package whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Unreleased Dependency version</strong> – Whenever possible, libraries should be using the latest released version for dependencies but there is the case where active development in one library is going to be needed by another
library or libraries that are built in separate pipelines. These types of changes are specifically additive and not breaking. Once a library has GA’d, nothing short of breaking changes should ever force the dependency versions
across the repo to an unreleased version. The reason for this is that it would prevent other libraries, that don’t need this change, from releasing. Unreleased dependencies of scope test will not prevent a library from being released.</p>
<p><strong>Released Beta Dependency version</strong> – This is for when a library, which has already GA'd, is being released as a Beta version, and we need to keep the dependency version to the latest GA. This particular tag will be used to
allow other libraries to depend on the released Beta version. Libraries with released Beta dependencies can only be released as Beta, themselves, as a library cannot GA with Beta dependencies. An exception to the previous rule
would be if the Beta dependency has a scope of test as this will not prevent a library from being released as GA.</p>
<p><strong>An example of Current vs Dependency versions:</strong> <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob-batch</code> has dependencies on <code>com.azure:azure-core</code>, <code>com.azure:azure-core-http-netty</code> and <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code>.
Because <code>com.azure:azure-core</code> and <code>com.azure:azure-core-http-netty</code> are both built outside azure-storage pipeline we should be using the released or <em>Dependency</em> versions of these when they're dependencies of another library.
Similarly, libraries built as part of the same pipeline, that have interdependencies, should be using the Current version. Since <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob-batch</code> and <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code> are both built part of the
azure-batch pipeline when <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code> is declared as a dependency of <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob-batch</code> it should be the <em>Current</em> version.</p>
<p><strong>An example of an Unreleased Dependency version:</strong> Additive, not breaking, API changes have been made to <code>com.azure:azure-core</code>. <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code> has a dependency on <code>com.azure:azure-core</code> and requires the additive
API change that has not yet been released. An unreleased entry needs to be created in <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/eng/versioning/version_client.txt">version_client.txt</a>, under the unreleased section, with the following format: <code>unreleased_&lt;groupId&gt;:&lt;artifactId&gt;;dependency-version</code>,
in this example that would be <code>unreleased_com.azure:azure-core;1.2.0</code> (this should match the 'current' version of core). The dependency update tags in the pom files that required this dependency would now reference
<code>{x-version-update;unreleased_com.azure:azure-core;dependency}</code>. Once the updated library has been released the unreleased dependency version should be removed and the POM file update tags should be referencing the released version.</p>
<h3 id="tooling-version-files-and-marker-tags">Tooling, version files and marker tags</h3>
<p>All the tooling lives under the <strong>eng\versioning</strong> directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>version_client.txt - Contains the Client library and versions</li>
<li>external_dependencies.txt - Contains the external dependency versions</li>
<li>update_versions.py - This is just a basic python script that will climb through the source tree and update POM and README files. The script utilizes tags within the files to do replacements and the tags are slightly different between the POM and README files.</li>
<li>set_versions.py - This script should only be used by the build system when we start producing nightly ops builds.</li>
</ul>
<p>In POM files this is done by inserting a specifically formatted comment on the same line as the version element.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;MyGroup&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;MyArtifact&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0.0-beta.1&lt;/version&gt; &lt;!-- {x-version-update;MyGroup:MyArtifact;[current|dependency]} --&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The last element of the tag would be current or dependency depending on the criteria previously explained.</p>
<p>In README files this ends up being slightly different. Because the version tag is inside an XML element that we're explicitly telling a user to copy/paste into their product the comment tag really didn't make sense here.
Instead, there are tags before and after the XML element tags which effectively says &quot;there's a version somewhere in between these two tags, when you find the line that matches replace it with the appropriate version of the
group:artifact defined in the tag.&quot;</p>
<pre><code>[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;MyGroup:MyArtifact;dependency})
```xml
  &lt;groupId&gt;MyGroup&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;MyArtifact&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0.0-beta.1&lt;/version&gt;
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})
</code></pre>
<h3 id="what-does-the-process-look-like">What does the process look like?</h3>
<p>Let's say we've GA'd and I need to tick up the version of azure-storage libraries how would I do it? Guidelines for incrementing versions after release can be found <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/docs/policies/releases.md#incrementing-after-release">here</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>I'd open up eng\versioning\version_client.txt and update the current-versions of the libraries that are built and released as part of the azure storage pipeline. This list can be found in pom.service.xml under the sdk/storage directory.
It's worth noting that any module entry starting with &quot;&quot; are external module dependencies and not something that's released as part of the pipeline. Dependencies for library components outside a given area would be downloading the
appropriate dependency from Maven like we do for external dependencies.</li>
<li>Execute the update_versions python script from the root of the enlistment. The exact syntax and commands will vary based upon what is being changed and some examples can be found in the use cases in the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/eng/versioning/update_versions.py#L6">update_versions.py</a> file.</li>
<li>Review and submit a PR with the modified files.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="next-steps-management-plane">Next steps: Management plane</h3>
<ul>
<li>Management plane. Management is in the process of being moved to service pipeline builds. The versioning work needs to wait until that work is finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-changes-to-a-gad-library-that-require-other-libraries-to-depend-on-the-unreleased-version">Making changes to a GA'd library that require other libraries to depend on the unreleased version</h3>
<p>This is where the <code>unreleased_</code> dependency tags come into play. Using the Unreleased Dependency example above, where <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code> has a dependency on an unreleased <code>com.azure:azure-core</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Make the additive changes to <code>com.azure:azure-core</code></li>
<li>[ ] In <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/eng/versioning/version_client.txt">version_client.txt</a> add the entry for the unreleased azure core in the unreleased section at the bottom of the file. The entry would look like <code>unreleased_com.azure:azure-core;&lt;version&gt;</code>.
Note: The version of the library referenced in the unreleased version tag should match the current version of that library.</li>
<li>[ ] In the pom.xml file for <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code>, the dependency tag for <code>com.azure:azure-core</code> which was originally <code>{x-version-update;com.azure:azure-core-test;dependency}</code> would now become <code>{x-version-update;unreleased_com.azure:azure-core-test;dependency}</code>
After the unreleased version of <code>com.azure:azure-core</code> was released but before <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code> has been released.</li>
<li>[ ] In <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/eng/versioning/version_client.txt">version_client.txt</a> the dependency version of <code>com.azure:azure-core</code> would become the released version and the &quot;unreleased_&quot; entry, at this time, would be removed.</li>
<li>[ ] In the pom.xml file for <code>com.azure:azure-storage-blob</code>, the dependency tag for <code>com.azure:azure-core</code> would get changed back to <code>{x-version-update;com.azure:azure-core-test;dependency}</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="packaging-versioning">Packaging Versioning</h2>
<p>For general packaging versioning policies see <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_releases.html#package-versioning">Package Versioning</a> and see <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_releases.html#java">Java</a> for specific rules used in this repo.</p>
<p>While some Java projects use SNAPSHOT versions for nightly builds, we have opted not to use that convention because it has proven to be very unreliable in our scenarios. For example, if we use SNAPSHOT versions in our pom.xml
files that usually ends up becoming viral throughout our entire repo and we want to more tightly control our versioning, especially our dependency versioning. On top of the viral nature, we have experienced a lot of network
reliability issues when consuming SNAPSHOT versions from Maven central so we want to avoid this reliability issue in our build pipelines.</p>
<p>Given we don't use SNAPSHOT versions in our pom.xml files we generally have the version currently under development committed to the repo in the pom.xml file. This means if you are looking at our active development code for the
version you will see a version that is not yet published to Maven central. If you want to try out our packages under development, you should look for our latest alpha build (see Dev Feed section below).</p>
<h3 id="dev-feed">Dev Feed</h3>
<p>Every day our engineering system produces a set of packages for each component of the SDK. These can be used by other projects to test updated builds of our libraries prior to their release. The packages are published to an
Azure Artifacts public feed hosted at the following URL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging?_a=feed&amp;feed=azure-sdk-for-java">https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging?_a=feed&amp;feed=azure-sdk-for-java</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For developers working within the repo, refer to the instructions above for updating versions numbers correctly. The parent POM for the Azure SDK already contains a repository reference to the daily feed and can download the packages.</p>
<p>For developers wishing to use the daily packages for other purposes, refer to the <a href="https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging?_a=connect&amp;feed=azure-sdk-for-java">connect to feed instructions</a> in Azure Artifacts.</p>
<p>Note: the daily package feed is considered volatile and taking dependencies on a daily package should be considered a temporary arrangement. We reserve the right to remove packages from this feed at any point in time.</p>
<h2 id="samples">Samples</h2>
<h3 id="third-party-dependencies">Third-party dependencies</h3>
<p>Third party libraries should only be included in samples when necessary to demonstrate usage of an Azure SDK package; they should not be suggested or endorsed as alternatives to the Azure SDK.</p>
<p>When code samples take dependencies, readers should be able to use the material without significant license burden or research on terms. This goal requires restricting dependencies to certain types of open source or commercial licenses.</p>
<p>Samples may take the following categories of dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open-source</strong> : Open source offerings that use an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license</a>. Any component whose license isn't OSI-approved is considered a commercial offering. Prefer OSS projects that are members of
the <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/ecosystem/">OSS foundations that Microsoft is part of</a>. Prefer permissive licenses for libraries, like <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache 2</a>. Copy-left licenses like <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GPL</a> are acceptable for tools, and OSs. <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json">Newtonsoft.Json</a> are examples of this license type. Links to open source components should be to where the source is hosted, including any applicable license, such as a GitHub repository (or similar).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commercial</strong>: Commercial offerings that enable readers to learn from our content without unnecessary extra costs. Typically, the offering has some form of a community edition, or a free trial sufficient for its use in content.
A commercial license may be a form of dual-license, or tiered license. Links to commercial components should be to the commercial site for the software, even if the source software is hosted publicly on GitHub (or similar).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dual licensed</strong>: Commercial offerings that enable readers to choose either license based on their needs. For example, if the offering has an OSS and commercial license, readers can  choose between them.
<a href="https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server">MySql</a> is an example of this license type.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tiered licensed</strong>: Offerings that enable readers to use the license tier that corresponds to their characteristics. For example, tiers may be available for students, hobbyists, or companies with defined revenue  thresholds.
For offerings with tiered licenses, strive to limit our use in tutorials to the features available in the lowest tier. This policy enables the widest audience for the article. <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver">IdentityServer</a>, <a href="https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp/">ImageSharp</a>,
and <a href="https://visualstudio.com">Visual Studio</a> are examples of this license type.</p>

<p>In general, we prefer taking dependencies on licensed components in the order of the listed categories. In cases where the category may not be well known, we'll document the category so that readers understand the choice that they're
making by using that dependency.</p>
