Changes in 0.6.0

BLOB
 * container.get{BlockBlob|PageBlob|Directory}Reference, directory.get{BlockBlob, PageBlob, SubDirectory}Reference always treat the string parameter as a relative address.
 * If the parent of a blob is the container, Cloud{BlockBlob|PageBlob|BlobDirectory}.getParent() returns a valid CloudBlobDirectory with an empty prefix. Similarly, container.getDirectoryReference("") gets a valid CloudBlobDirectory representing the container.
 * Blob downloads resume on every retry.
 * Fixed snapshot creates to inherit base blob's metadata/properties unless metadata/properties are specified.
 * Deprecated CloudPageBlob openOutputStream methods in favor of equivalent openWriteNew methods.
 * CloudBlobContainer(String, CloudBlobClient) and CloudBlobClient.getContainerReference(String) always treat the string parameter as a relative address.

 * Any exception thrown while parsing an error response is ignored and the original exception is returned.

Changes in 0.5.0

 BLOB 
 * Removed setCopyState property from CloudBlob (was marked RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE, but this was still accessible.)
 * Modified the CloudBlobContainer exists, delete, uploadMetadata, downloadAttributes APIs to take AccessCondition in order to specify LeaseIDs for these operations.
 * Added throws StorageException to listBlobs and listContainers.
 * Added throws XMLStreamException to commitBlockList.
 * Container and Blob ChangeLease now returns the new lease ID.
 * Blob downloadRange now takes a Long for length instead of int.
 * Blob downloadRange now downloads to a Stream(newly added). The previous downloadRange has been renamed to downloadRangeToByteArray. Added downloadToByteArray.
 * getAttributes in ContainerResponse was made protected (the class was marked RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE, but this was still accessible.)
 * Removed sparse page blob feature.
 * Moved LeaseAction enum from core package to blob package (was marked RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE, but this was still accessible.)
 * CloudBlobContainer.createIfNotExist was renamed to CloudBlobContainer.createIfNotExists.
 * CloudBlobClient.streamMinimumReadSizeInBytes has been removed.  This functionality is now CloudBlob.streamMinimumReadSizeInBytes (settable per-blob, not per-client.)
 * CloudBlobClient.pageBlobStreamWriteSizeInBytes and CloudBlobClient.writeBlockSizeInBytes have been removed.  This functionality is now CloudBlob.streamWriteSizeInBytes, settable per-blob, and now using only one variable.
 * copyFromBlob has been renamed to startCopyFromBlob. This API requests the service to start copying a blob's contents, properties, and metadata to a new blob and returns the copy ID associated with the copy operation.
 * CloudBlob.tryBreakLease() was removed, as this method didn't do anything useful (BreakLease is already idempotent.)
 * Removed all getDirectoryReference, getPageBlobReference, getBlockBlobReference methods from CloudBlobClient.
 * CloudContainer(String name, CloudBlobClient client) assert that client is not null.

 QUEUE
 * CloudQueue.createIfNotExist was renamed to CloudQueue.createIfNotExists.
 * CloudQueue(String name, CloudQueueClient client) assert that client is not null.

 TABLE
 * Removed id field (along with getId, setId) from TableResult.
 * CloudTable.createIfNotExist was renamed to CloudTable.createIfNotExists.
 * CloudTable(String name, CloudTableClient client) assert that client is not null.
 * inserts in TableOperation and TableBatchOperation do not echo content any more. This will cause the resulting HTTP status code on the TableResult for successful inserts to be 204 (no-content) rather than 201 (Created). Echo content can be re-enabled by using the insert(TableEntity, boolean) method and specifying true.
 * Added throws StorageException to executeQuery methods for tables.

 OTHER
 * The packaging structure has changed to
	1. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage � RetryPolicies, LocationMode, StorageException, Storage Credentials etc. Basically all public classes that are common across services.
	2. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.core � These classes are reserved for internal use and users never have to include this namespace in their projects. 
	3. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob
	4. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.queue
	5. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.table
 * StorageErrorConstants: INVALID_XML_NODE_VALUE, UNSUPPORTED_XML_NODE has been removed.
 * RetryResult class has been replaced by the RetryInfo class. Custom retry policies should implement RetryPolicyFactory and extend RetryPolicy.
 * Event operations (including event firing) that occur during a request are no longer synchronized, thread safety is now guaranteed by a CopyOnWriteArrayList of the event listeners.
 * Many project dependencies were removed from the pom. Current dependencies are junit, hamcrest, commons-lang3, jackson, and slf4j.
