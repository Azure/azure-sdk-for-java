# Azure Batch SDK for Java release notes

## Changes in 5.0.0
### Features
- **[Breaking]** Removed support for the `ChangeOSVersion` API on `CloudServiceConfiguration` pools. 
  - Removed `PoolOperations.ChangeOSVersion`.
  - Renamed `TargetOSVersion` to `OSVersion` and removed `CurrentOSVersion` on `CloudPool`.
  - Removed `PoolState.Upgrading` enum.
- **[Breaking]** Removed `DataEgressGiB` and `DataIngressGiB` from `PoolUsageMetrics`. These properties are no longer supported.
- **[Breaking]** ResourceFile improvements
  - Added the ability specify an entire Azure Storage container in `ResourceFile`. There are now three supported modes for `ResourceFile`:
    - `ResourceFile.withUrl` creates a `ResourceFile` pointing to a single HTTP URL.
    - `ResourceFile.withStorageContainerUrl` creates a `ResourceFile` pointing to an Azure Blob Storage container.
    - `ResourceFile.withAutoStorageContainer` creates a `ResourceFile` pointing to an Azure Blob Storage container in the Batch registered auto-storage account.
      - The `BlobPrefix` property can be used to filter downloads from a storage container to only those matching the prefix.
  - URLs provided to `ResourceFile` via the `ResourceFile.withUrl` method can now be any HTTP URL. Previously, these had to be an Azure Blob Storage URL.
- **[Breaking]** Removed `OSDisk` property from `VirtualMachineConfiguration`. This property is no longer supported.
- Pools which set the `DynamicVNetAssignmentScope` on `NetworkConfiguration` to be `DynamicVNetAssignmentScope.Job` can 
  now dynamically assign a Virtual Network to each node the job's tasks run on. The specific Virtual Network to join the nodes to is specified in 
  the new `JobNetworkConfiguration` property on `CloudJob` and `JobSpecification`. 
  - Note: This feature is in public preview. It is disabled for all Batch accounts except for those which have contacted us and requested to be in the pilot.
- The maximum lifetime of a task is now 180 days (previously it was 7).
- Added support on Windows pools for creating users with a specific login mode (either `Batch` or `Interactive`) via `WindowsUserConfiguration.LoginMode`.
- The default task retention time for all tasks is now 7 days, previously it was infinite.

### REST API version
This version of the Batch Java client library targets version 2018-08-01.7.1 of the Azure Batch REST API. See this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/batchservice/batch-service-rest-api-versioning#latest-version-2018-08-0171) for detail.

## Changes in 3.3.0
### Features
 - `createTasks` rethrow `RuntimeException` catched by internal threads. 
 - `createTasks` handle `RequestSizeTooLarge` chunking errors for well behaved tasks.

## Changes in 3.2.0
### Features
 - Update comments for some classes and properties.
 - Added the `leavingPool` property to `NodeCounts` class.

## Changes in 3.1.0
### Features
 - Added the ability to query pool node counts by state, via the new `listPoolNodeCounts` method on `PoolOperations`.
 - Added the ability to upload Azure Batch node agent logs from a particular node, via the `uploadComputeNodeBatchServiceLogs` method on `ComputeNodeOperations`.
   - This is intended for use in debugging by Microsoft support when there are problems on a node.

### REST API version
This version of the Batch Java client library targets version 2018-03-01.6.1 of the Azure Batch REST API. See this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/batchservice/batch-service-rest-api-versioning#latest-version-2018-03-0161) for detail.


## Changes in 3.0.0
### Features
- Added the ability to get a discount on Windows VM pricing if you have on-premises licenses for the OS SKUs you are deploying, via `licenseType` on `VirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- Added support for attaching empty data drives to `VirtualMachineConfiguration` based pools, via the new `dataDisks` property on `VirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- **[Breaking]** Custom images must now be deployed using a reference to an ARM Image, instead of pointing to .vhd files in blobs directly.
  - The new `virtualMachineImageId` property on `ImageReference` contains the reference to the ARM Image, and `OSDisk.imageUris` no longer exists.
  - Because of this, `imageReference` is now a required property of `VirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- **[Breaking]** Multi-instance tasks (created using `MultiInstanceSettings`) must now specify a `coordinationCommandLine`, and `numberOfInstances` is now optional and defaults to 1.
- Added support for tasks run using Docker containers. To run a task using a Docker container you must specify a `containerConfiguration` on the `VirtualMachineConfiguration` for a pool, and then add `taskContainerSettings` on the Task.
