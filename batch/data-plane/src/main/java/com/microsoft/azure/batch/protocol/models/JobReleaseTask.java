/**
 * A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node where the
 * job has run.
 * The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the
 * following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while
 * the job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time constraint is
 * reached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job Manager task
 * completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager
 * completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of the
 * job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and completed. If you reimage
 * a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends
 * without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node (and hence
 * the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does
 * not run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task
 * is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node
 * starts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks
 * have completed. The Job Release task runs in the background. It does not
 * occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the
 * maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.
