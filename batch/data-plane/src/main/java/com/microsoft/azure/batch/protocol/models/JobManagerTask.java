/**
 * Specifies details of a Job Manager task.
 * The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The
 * Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks
 * in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve
 * compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible
 * (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job
 * Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the
 * system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle
 * nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the
 * pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager
 * task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have
 * priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities
 * are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be
 * restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry
 * tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of
 * recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
 * compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure.
 * Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted
 * against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an
 * internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all
 * tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.
