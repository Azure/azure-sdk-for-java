 * A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure Batch

 * Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
 * node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when
 * an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to
 * host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are
 * not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is
 * 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,
 * all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing.
