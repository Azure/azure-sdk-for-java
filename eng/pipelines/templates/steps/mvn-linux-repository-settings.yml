steps:
  # /eng/repo-docs/docms/daily.update.setting.xml contains two settings
  # 1. The java dev feed - This is for nightly builds and official builds, both of which publish
  #    to the dev feed. In the case of official builds, setting this up prevents us from having
  #    to deal with sonatype which may have a delay before what was just published is available.
  #    The dev feed does not have the same delay that sonatype does.
  # 2. The docs-public-packages dev feed. This is where the docs java library, java2docfx is
  #    published. Nightly builds and official releases are published here and, while official releases
  #    are also published to sonatype, it's better to hit the public dev feed whenever possible.
