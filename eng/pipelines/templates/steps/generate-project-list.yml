# This job template uses the artifact list in the ci.yml file
# to generate a variable at build time that can be passed into
# the Maven -pl command-line switch to constrain what subset of
# projects are targetted based on the artifacts this pipeline
# produces. The -am and -amd switches are then applied as
# appropriate to constrain the full graph that is built depending
# on whether we are doing a recorded test play back or a full live
# test.
