# This job template uses the artifact list in the ci.yml file
# to generate a variable at build time that can be passed into
# the Maven -pl command-line switch to constrain what subset of
# projects are targeted based on the artifacts this pipeline
# produces. The -am and -amd switches are then applied as
# appropriate to constrain the full graph that is built depending
# on whether we are doing a recorded test play back or a full live
# test.

# The project list is also being used as a cache key.

# Create the ProjectList and ProjectListSha256 variables.
# The ProjectList is used by subsequent steps and tasks to run CI.
# The ProjectListSha256 is used by the cache key, previously the cache key was using ProjectList but it was found
# that long cache keys cause caching to fail.

# ArtifactPackageNames is set by the generate test matrix and is only set for test runs. This needs to be
# used to correctly set the project list and additional modules for what should be running for this particular
# matrix run. The reason for this is that different service directories, like clientcore, have their own
# default test matrix as compared to something like azure-template, which uses the default test matrix
