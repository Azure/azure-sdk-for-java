# This job template uses the artifact list in the ci.yml file
# to generate a variable at build time that can be passed into
# the Maven -pl command-line switch to constrain what subset of
# projects are targeted based on the artifacts this pipeline
# produces. The -am and -amd switches are then applied as
# appropriate to constrain the full graph that is built depending
# on whether we are doing a recorded test play back or a full live
# test.

# The project list is also being used as a cache key.

  # The ProjectList is used by subsequent steps and tasks to run CI.
  # The ProjectListSha256 is used by the cache key, previously the cache key was using ProjectList but it was found
  # that long cache keys cause caching to fail.
