# This script is used to prepare the patch release by generating patches for automatic releases.
# It should be triggered manually by the release driver. Release driver should ensure that the CI pipeline is green
# before manually trigger the patch release pipeline, 'java - patch-release'.
# The release driver should also ensure that the patches are generated successfully and the PR is created successfully.
#
# What this script does:
#   - Checks out a new release branch, 'release/patch/$currentDate'
#   - Runs the script to generate patches for automatic releases
#   - Create a PR with the patches prepared
