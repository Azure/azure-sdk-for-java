    # Note: The ExcludePaths template below needs to duplicate
    # any excludes here. The reason being is that we can't access
    # pr->paths->exclude. Path matching is done with startsWith
    # meaning that path entries should end with a trailing "/" in
    # order to prevent greedy matching. Centralized versioning files
    # are added to this list to prevent the PR pipeline from running
    # when it shouldn't. When someone updates these files there will
    # be other updates that'll cause the PR pipeline, or the appropriate
    # pipeline if not PR, to run.
