# This document contains a list of artifacts that have opted-in to be a part of the automated patch release process.
#
# An automated patch release for a library contains updates to a library's dependencies, CHANGELOG and README only,
# compared to the latest stable version. No other changes shall be included as part of such a release.
#
# Currently, the process only handles data plane libraries (those under the 'com.azure' group ID), meaning this will
# not work for perf, management plane or Spring libraries.
#
# Libraries listed here will not be released if a stable version for them has already been released for a given release
# cycle by the time the script is run. So, if a library owner needs to release a bugfix, performance improvement or new
# features, they should go ahead with their release during release week and not worry about updating this list. The
# automated release process will happen the week after release week.
