# This document contains a list of artifacts that have opted-in to be a part of the automated patch release process.
#
# An automated patch release for a library contains updates to a library's dependencies, CHANGELOG and README only,
# compared to the latest stable version. No other changes shall be included as part of such a release.
#
# Currently, the process only handles data plane libraries (those under the 'com.azure' group ID), meaning this will
# not work for management plane or Spring libraries.
#
# Libraries listed here will not be released for a given release cycle if a new stable version for them has been marked
# for release in our Azure DevOps portal either manually or by using the /eng/common/scripts/Prepare-Release.ps1 script.
# Marking a library for a beta release will not affect this process.
