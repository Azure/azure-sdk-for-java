# Engineering Tools

All the tools/utilities used in Microsoft Azure Java SDK's build config are defined here.

- `common` - Set of common engineering scripts that sync from our azure-sdk-tools repo. Generally shouldn't be edited directly in this repo.

- `pipelines` - Directory that contains yml files for our DevOps pipelines or supporting yml templates for them.
