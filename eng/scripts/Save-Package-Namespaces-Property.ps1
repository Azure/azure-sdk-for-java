.SYNOPSIS
Given an artifact staging directory, loop through all of the PackageInfo files
in the PackageInfo subdirectory and compute the namespaces if they don't already
exist. Yes, they're called packages in Java but namespaces are being used to keep
code that processes them common amongst the languages.

.DESCRIPTION
Given an artifact staging directory, loop through all of the PackageInfo files
in the PackageInfo subdirectory. For each PackageInfo file, find its corresponding
javadoc jar file and use that to compute the namespace information.

.PARAMETER ArtifactStagingDirectory
The root directory of the staged artifacts. The PackageInfo files will be in the
PackageInfo subdirectory. The artifacts root directories are GroupId based, meaning
any artifact with that GroupId will be in a subdirectory. For example: Most Spring
libraries are com.azure.spring and their javadoc jars will be under that subdirectory
but azure-spring-data-cosmos' GroupId is com.azure and its javadoc jar will be under
com.azure.

.PARAMETER ArtifactsList
The list of artifacts to gather namespaces for, this is only done for libraries that are
producing docs.
