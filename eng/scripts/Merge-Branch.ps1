# Use case: This script merges changes from a source branch into the current branch with the behavior:
# 1. Overwrite paths matching $Theirs (this includes deletes)
# 2. Ensure files in $Ours remain untouched
# 3. For paths matching $Merge, merge changes from $SourceBranch allowing the user to resolve conflicts manually
#
# Adding paths to $Merge excludes them from the default keep or overwrite behaviour of $Ours and $Theirs.
#
# This script can be run locally from the root of the repo:
# .\eng\scripts\Merge-Branch.ps1 -SourceBranch 'main' -Theirs '**' -Ours 'sdk/template' -Merge 'sdk/template/ci.yml', '**/README.md'
#
# This would merge main into the local branch, making the working folder look like main. It will not overwrite sdk\template.
# Changes in sdk\template\ci.yml and readme.md files would be merged, not excluded or overwritten.

#
# - They're space separeted strings that match file paths in the repository
# - They're repository paths, not filesystem paths and are slash direction sensitive.
# - They support "magic words" between parenthesis that control how the following path matches files:
#   - top: treat the path a top level / repository rooted
#   - glob: treat wildcards using glob patterns
#       /*/ == single wildcarded directory level
#       /**/ == all subdirectories, recursive
#   - exclude: after processing other pathspecs, remove any path matching this pathspec from the results

# Apply git pathspec magic to the paths
