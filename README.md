[![Packages](https://img.shields.io/badge/packages-latest-blue.svg)](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/java.html) [![Build Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-published-blue.svg)](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-java)

This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for Java. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/sdk/) or our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-java).

## Getting started

To get started with a specific service library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory. For a list of all the services we support access our [list of all existing libraries](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/java.html).

For tutorials, samples, quick starts and other documentation, visit [Azure for Java Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/).

### Prerequisites

All libraries are baselined on Java 8, with testing and forward support up until the latest Java long-term support release (currently Java 17).

## Available packages

Each service can have both 'client' and 'management' libraries. 'Client' libraries are used to consume the service, whereas 'management' libraries are used to configure and manage the service.

### Client Libraries

Our client libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java/guidelines/), and share a number of core features such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc., so that once you learn how to use these features in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries. You can learn about these shared features [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/sdk/overview).
These libraries can be easily identified by folder, package, and namespaces names starting with `azure-`, e.g. `azure-keyvault`.

You can find the **[most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#java)**. This list includes the most recent releases: both stable and beta.

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-beta libraries.

### Management Libraries

Similar to our client libraries, the management libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java/guidelines/). These libraries provide a high-level, object-oriented API for _managing_ Azure resources, that are optimized for ease of use, succinctness, and consistency. You can find the list of management libraries **[on this page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/java.html)**.

**For general documentation on how to use the new libraries for Azure Resource Management, please [visit here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/java/mgmt)**. We have also prepared **[plenty of code samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/resourcemanager/docs/SAMPLE.md)** as well as **[migration guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/resourcemanager/docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** in case you are upgrading from previous versions.

The management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-resourcemanager`, e.g. `azure-resourcemanager-compute`.

### Historical Releases

Note that the latest libraries from Microsoft are in the `com.azure` Maven group ID, and have the package naming pattern of beginning with `com.azure`. If you're using libraries that are in `com.microsoft.azure` Maven group ID, or have this as the package structure, please consider migrating to the latest libraries. You can find a mapping table from these historical releases to their equivalent [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/deprecated/index.html#java).

## Navigating the repository

### Main branch

The main branch has the most recent code with new features and bug fixes. It does **not** represent latest released **stable** SDK.

### Release branches (Release tagging)

For each package we release there will be a unique git tag created that contains the name and the version of the package to mark the commit of the code that produced the package. This tag will be used for servicing via hotfix branches as well as debugging the code for a particular beta or stable release version.
Format of the release tags are `<package-name>_<package-version>`. For more information please see [our branching strategy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/docs/policies/repobranching.md#release-tagging).
