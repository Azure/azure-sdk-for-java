This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for Java. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/) or our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-java).

## Getting started

To get started with a specific service library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory. For a list of all the services we support access our [list of all existing libraries](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/java.html).

For tutorials, samples, quick starts and other documentation, visit [Azure for Java Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/).

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or later is required to use libraries under the `com.azure` package, for libraries under the `com.microsoft.azure` package Java 7 or later is required.

## Available packages

Each service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:

- [Client: New Releases](#client-new-releases)
- [Client: Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
- [Management: New Releases](#management-new-releases)
- [Management: Previous Versions](#management-previous-versions)

### Client: New Releases

New wave of packages that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java/guidelines/) and share a number of core features such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc., so that once you learn how to use these features in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries. You can learn about these shared features [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).
These libraries can be easily identified by folder, package, and namespaces names starting with `azure-`, e.g. `azure-keyvault`.

You can find the **[most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#java)**. This list includes the most recent releases: both GA and preview.

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.

### Client: Previous Versions

Last stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide similar functionalities to the new libraries, as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. Previous library directories start with `microsoft-azure-`, e.g. `microsoft-azure-keyvault`. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html) or have the same feature set as the new releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.

### Management: New Releases
A new set of management libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java/guidelines/) are now Generally Available (GA) and ready for production uses. These new libraries provide a higher-level, object-oriented API for _managing_ Azure resources, that is optimized for ease of use, succinctness and consistency. You can find the list of new packages **[on this page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/java.html)**.

**For general documentation on how to use the new libraries for Azure Resource Management, please [visit here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/java/mgmt)**. We have also prepared **[plenty of code samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/resourcemanager/docs/SAMPLE.md)** as well as **[migraton guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/resourcemanager/docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** in case you are upgrading from previous versions.

New Management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-resourcemanager`, e.g. `azure-resourcemanager-compute`

### Management: Previous Versions
For a complete list of management libraries which enable you to provision and manage Azure resources, please check [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/java.html). They might not have the same feature set as the new releases but they do offer wider coverage of services.
Previous versions of management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-mgmt-`, e.g. `azure-mgmt-compute`

## Navigating the repository

### Master branch

The master branch has the most recent code with new features and bug fixes. It does **not** represent latest released **GA** SDK. See [above](#client-new-releases) for latest **GA** release.<br/>

### Release branches (Release tagging)

For each package we release there will be a unique git tag created that contains the name and the version of the package to mark the commit of the code that produced the package. This tag will be used for servicing via hotfix branches as well as debugging the code for a particular preview or stable release version.
Format of the release tags are `<package-name>_<package-version>`. For more information please see [our branching strategy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/master/docs/policies/repobranching.md#release-tagging).
