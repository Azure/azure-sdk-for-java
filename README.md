This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for Java. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/) or our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-java).

### Important

The Azure SDK team is pleased to make available the January 2020 client library General Availability (GA) release. We strongly recommend using the GA libraries in all production environments as these libraries are well tested and officially supported by Microsoft. More details, including installation instructions can be found here [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2020-01/java.html).

## Getting started

To get started with a specific library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.

For tutorials, samples, quick starts and other documentation, visit [Azure for Java Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/).

### Prerequisites

Java 8 or later is required to use the January 2020 client libraries, otherwise Java 7 or later is required.

## Latest Release

Each service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:

- [Client: GA January 2020 Releases](#Client-GA-January-2020-Releases)
- [Client - Previous Versions](#Client-Previous-Versions)
- [Management](#Management)

### Client: GA January 2020 Releases

New wave of packages that were released in January 2020 client library as General Availability (GA) and several others that were released in **beta**. These libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java/guidelines/) and share a number of core features such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc., so that once you learn how to use these features in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries. You can learn about these shared features [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/azure-core_1.2.0/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).

These libraries can be easily identified by sdk/ folder, package, and namespaces names starting with `azure-`, e.g. `azure-keyvault`.

The libraries released in the GA January 2020 release is listed below.

- [July 2019](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2019-07-10/java.html)

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.

### Client: Previous Versions

Last stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide similar functionalities to the preview libraries, as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. Stable library directories start with `microsoft-azure-`, e.g. `microsoft-azure-keyvault`. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html) or have the same feature set as the GA releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.

### Management

Libraries which enable you to provision specific resources. They are responsible for directly mirroring and consuming Azure service's REST endpoints. Management library directories contain `-mgmt-`, e.g. `azure-mgmt-keyvault`.

## Navigating the repository

### Master branch
The master branch has the most recent code with new features and bug fixes. It does **not** represent latest released **GA** SDK. See [above](#Client-GA-January-2020-Releases) for latest **GA** release.<br/>

### Release branches (Release tagging)

For each package we release there will be a unique git tag created that contains the name and the version of the package to mark the commit of the code that produced the package. This tag will be used for servicing via hotfix branches as well as debugging the code for a particular preview or stable release version.
Format of the release tags are `<package-name>_<package-version>`. For more information please see [our branching strategy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/master/docs/policies/repobranching.md#release-tagging).
